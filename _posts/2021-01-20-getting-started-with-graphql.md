GraphQL was developed by Facebook in 2012 for their mobile apps. It was open-sourced in 2015 and is now used by many development teams, including some prominent ones like GitHub, Twitter, and Airbnb. Here we will see what GraphQL is and explain its usage with some simple examples.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a specification of a query language for APIs. The client or API consumer sends the request in a query language containing the fields it requires and the server returns only the requested fields instead of the complete payload. 

Instead of having many different endpoints, as we would have with REST, **we have a single endpoint to which the consumer sends different queries depending on the data of interest**. A sample GraphQL query and its response might look like this:

GraphQL query:
```graphql
{
    Product
    {
        title
        description
        category      
    }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "Product": {
            "title": "Television",
            "description": "My 25 inch Television",
            "category": "Electronic Goods"
        }
    }
}
```
In this sample, we send a request for fetching a product with attributes title, description, and category, and the server returns the response containing only those fields (title, description, and category). 

GraphQL shifts some responsibility to the client for constructing the query containing only the fields of its interest. The server is responsible for processing the query and then fetching the data from an underlying system like a database or a web service.

So, instead of the server providing multiple APIs for different needs of the consumer, the onus is thrown to the consumer to fetch only the data it's interested in. 

## GraphQL Schema
GraphQL is language-agnostic so it defines its own query language and a schema definition language (SDL). 

So, to define what data we can get from a GraphQL endpoint, we need to define a schema.

A `Type` is the most basic component of a GraphQL schema and represents a kind of object we can fetch from our service. 

### Scalar and Object Types
We create a GraphQL schema by defining types and then providing functions for each type. Similar to the types in many programming languages, a type can be a scalar like int, string, decimal, etc, or an object type formed with a combination of multiple scalar and complex types. 

An example of types for a GraphQL service that fetches a list of recent purchases looks like this:
```graphql
type Product {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    description: String!
    category: String
    madeBy: Manufacturer!
}

type Manufacturer {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    address: String
}
```
Here we have defined the object types `Product` and `Manufacturer`. 

`Manufacturer` is composed of scalar types with the names `id`, `name`, and `address`. Similarly, the `Product` type is composed of four scalar types with the names `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, and an object type `Manufacturer`.

### Special Types: Query, Mutation, and Subscription
We need to add root types to the GraphQL schema for adding functionality to the API. The GraphQL schema has three root-level types: Query, Mutation, and Subscription. These are special types and signify the entry point of a GraphQL service. Of these three, only the Query type is mandatory for every GraphQL service. 

**The root types determine the shape of the queries and mutations that will be accepted by the server.** 

An example `Query` root type for a GraphQL service that fetches a list of recent purchases looks like this:

```graphql
type Query {
    myRecentPurchases(count: Int, customerID: String): [Product]!
}
```
This query fetches the specified number of recent purchases for a customer.

A Mutation represents changes that we can make on our objects. Our schema with a `Mutation` will look like this:

```graphql
type Mutation {
    addPurchases(count: Int, customerID: String): [Product]!
}
```
This mutation is used to add purchases of a customer.

Subscription is another special type for real-time push-style updates. Subscriptions depend on the use of a publishing mechanism to generate the event that notifies a subscription that is subscribed to that event. Our schema with a Subscription will look like this:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  newProduct: Product!
}

```
This is a subscription for adding a new `Product`.

## Server-Side Implementation
GraphQL has several [server-side](https://graphql.org/code/#javascript-server) implementations available in multiple languages. These implementations roughly follow a pipeline pattern with the following stages:

1. We expose an endpoint that accepts GraphQL queries. 
2. We define a schema with types, queries, and mutations. 
3. We associate a function called "resolver" for each type to fetch data from underlying systems. 

A GraphQL endpoint can live alongside REST APIs. Similar to REST, the GraphQL endpoint will also depend on a business logic layer for fetching data from underlying systems.

Support for GraphQL constructs varies across implementations. While the basic types Query and Mutation are supported across all implementations,  support for the Subscription type is not available in a few.

## Client-Side Implementations
The consumers of the GraphQL API use the query language defined by the server's schema to request the specific data of their interest. 

On the client-side, at the most basic level, we can send the query as a JSON payload in a POST request to a `graphql` endpoint:

```shell
curl --request POST 'localhost:8080/graphql' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
 --data-raw \
 '{"query":"query {myRecentPurchases(count:10){title,description}}"}'
```
Here we send a request for fetching 10 recent purchases with the fields title, and description in each record.

To avoid making the low-level HTTP calls, we should use a GraphQL client library as an abstraction layer. Among other things, the GraphQL client library will take care of

* sending the request and handling the response,
* integrating with the view layer and optimistic UI updates, and
* caching query results.

There are several [client frameworks](https://graphql.org/code/#javascript-client) available with popular ones being the [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), [Relay (from Facebook)](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), and [urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql).

## Building a GraphQL Server with Spring Boot

We will use a Spring Boot application to build a GraphQL server implementation. For this, let us first create a Spring Boot application with the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.2.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=io.pratik&artifactId=graphqldemo&name=graphqldemo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20GraphQL%20with%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=io.pratik.graphqldemo&dependencies=web,lombok,h2). 

You can find the code of the complete example application [on GitHub](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/graphql).

### Adding GraphQL Dependencies
For the GraphQL server, we will add the following Maven dependencies: 

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
      <artifactId>graphql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
      <version>5.0.2</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
      <artifactId>graphql-java-tools</artifactId>
      <version>5.2.4</version>
    </dependency>
```
Here we have added `graphql-spring-boot-starter` as a GraphQL starter and a Java tools module `graphql-java-tools`.

### Defining the GraphQL Schema 
We can either take a top-down approach by defining the schema and then creating the POJOs for each type or a bottom-up approach by creating the POJOs first and then create a schema from those POJOs. 

We opt for the first approach and create our schema first. The GraphQL schema needs to be defined in a file with the extension `graphqls` and needs to live in the `resources` folder. 

Let's define our schema in a file `src/main/resources/product.graphqls`:

```graphql
type Product {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    description: String!
    category: String
    madeBy: Manufacturer!
}

type Manufacturer {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    address: String
}

# The Root Query for the application
type Query {
    myRecentPurchases(count: Int, customerID: String): [Product]!
    lastVisitedProducts(count: Int, customerID: String): [Product]!
    productsByCategory(category: String): [Product]!
}

# The Root Mutation for the application
type Mutation {
    addRecentProduct(title: String!, description: String!, category: String) : Product!
}

```
Here we have added three operations to our Query and a Mutation for adding recent products.

Next, we define the POJO classes for the Object types `Product` and `Manufacturer`:

```java
public class Product {
  private String id; 
  private String title;
  private String description; 
  private String category;
  private Manufacturer madeBy;
}

public class Manufacturer {
  private String id;
  private String name;
  private String address;
}
```
This `Product` POJO maps to the `product` type and `Manufacturer` maps to the `manufacturer` object defined in our GraphQL schema. 


### Associate GraphQL Types with Resolvers

Multiple resolver components convert the GraphQl request received from the API consumers and invoke operations to fetch data from applicable data sources. For each type, we define a `resolver`.

We will now add resolvers for all the types defined in the schema. The resolver classes need to implement `GraphQLQueryResolver` for the `Query` object and `GraphQLMutationResolver`for the `Mutation` object. As explained earlier, `Query` and `Mutation` are the root GraphQL objects. 

When a GraphQL request is received, the fields in the root types are resolved to the output of the executed methods in these resolver classes. 

Let's first add a resolver class named `QueryResolver` containing the methods corresponding to the fields in our GraphQL `Query` object: 

```java
@Service
public class QueryResolver implements GraphQLQueryResolver {

  private ProductRepository productRepository;
  
  @Autowired
  public QueryResolver(final ProductRepository productRepository) {
    super();
    this.productRepository = productRepository;
  }

  public List<Product> getMyRecentPurchases(
      final Integer count, String customerID) {

    List<Product> products = productRepository
                         .getRecentPurchases(count);

    return products;
  }

  public List<Product> getLastVisitedProducts(
      final Integer count, final String customerID) {
    List<Product> products = productRepository
                         .getLastVisitedPurchases(count);
    return products;
  }

  public List<Product> getProductsByCategory(
      final String category) {
    List<Product> products = productRepository
                         .getProductsByCategory(category);
    return products;
  }

}
```
We have defined the `QueryResolver` class as a Service class to resolve the root Query type in our GraphQL schema. In our example app, this service class is injected with a `ProductRepository` object to fetch product data from an H2 Database.

We next add a resolver for the `Manufacturer` object type:
```java
@Service
public class ProductResolver implements GraphQLResolver<Product>{

  private ManufacturerRepository manufacturerRepository;
  
  @Autowired
  public ProductResolver(ManufacturerRepository manufacturerRepository) {
    super();
    this.manufacturerRepository = manufacturerRepository;
  }

  public Manufacturer getMadeBy(final Product product) {
    return manufacturerRepository
       .getManufacturerById(product.getManufacturerID());
  }
}
```
The GraphQL library will automatically call this resolver for each `Product` to resolve its `madeBy` field with a `Manufacturer` object. This happens only if the consumer has requested the `madeBy` field, of course.

Similar to the resolver for `Query` object types, let us add a resolver for the `Mutation` root object type:

```java
@Service
public class Mutation implements GraphQLMutationResolver{

  public Product addRecentProduct(
    final String title, 
    final String description, 
    final String category) {
    
    return Product.builder()
           .title("television")
           .category("electronic")
           .build();
  }
}

```
Here the `Mutation` class implements `GraphQLMutationResolver` and contains a method `addRecentProduct` which maps to the field in the `Mutation` root object type.

### Connecting to Datasources and Applying Middleware Logic
Next, we will enable our resolvers to fetch data from underlying data sources like a database or web service. For this example, we have configured an in-memory H2 database as the data store for `products` and `manufacturers`. We use Spring JDBC to retrieve data from the database and put this logic in separate repository classes. 

Apart from fetching data, we can also build different categories of middleware logic in this business service layer. A few examples of middleware logic are:

* authorization of incoming requests,
* applying filters on data fetched from backend,
* transformation into backend data models, and
* caching rarely changing data.

### Running the Application
After compiling and running the application, we can send GraphQL queries to the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/graphql`. A sample GraphQL query and response might look like this:

GraphQL query:
```graphql
query 
{
    myRecentPurchases(count: 2)
    {
        title
        description
    }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "myRecentPurchases": [
            {
                "title": "Samsung TV",
                "description": "Samsung Television"
            },
            {
                "title": "Macbook Pro 13",
                "description": "Macbook pro 13 inch laptop"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## GraphQL vs. REST
REST has been the de-facto standard style for building APIs. Good API designs are usually driven by consumer needs which vary depending on the consumer. Let's look at some differences between REST and GraphQL. 

### Over Fetching and Under Fetching
With REST, we might require multiple APIs to retrieve different "shapes" of the same product data. Alternately we might fetch the entire product data with all its relations every time even though we only need a part of the data. 

**GraphQL tries to solve the problems of over fetching and under fetching data.** With GraphQL, we will have a single endpoint on which the consumer can send different queries depending on the data of interest.

### Shape of the API
REST APIs are based on resources that are identified by URLs and an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) indicating one of the CRUD operations. GraphQL, in contrast, is based on a data graph that is returned in response to a request sent as a query to a fixed endpoint.

### HTTP Status Codes
REST APIs are mostly designed to return 2xx status codes for success and 4xx and 5xx for failures. GraphQL APIs return 200 as status code irrespective of whether it is a success or failure. 

### Health Check
With REST APIs, we check for a 2xx status code on a specific endpoint to check if the API is healthy and capable of serving the requests. In GraphQL, health checking is relatively complex since the monitoring function needs to parse the response body to check the server status.

### Caching
With REST APIs, the GET endpoints are cached in the application layer or by using a CDN. With GraphQL, we need to cache on the client-side, which is supported by some GraphQL client implementations. Apollo Client and URQL, for example, make use of GraphQL's schema and type system using introspection to maintain a client-side cache. 

GraphQL is however known to break server-side caching because of the varying nature of requests. Server-side caching is at present not standardized across libraries. More information about server-side caching is found in the [GraphQL Portal](https://graphql.org/learn/caching/).

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at the main capabilities of GraphQL and how it helps to solve some common problems associated with consuming APIs. 

We also looked at GraphQL's Schema Definition Language (SDL) along with the root types: Query, Mutation, and Subscription followed by how it is implemented on the server-side with the help of resolver functions. 

We finally set up a GraphQL server implementation with the help of two Spring modules and defined a schema with a Query and Mutation. We then defined resolver functions to connect the query with the underlying data source in the form of an H2 database. 

GraphQL is a powerful mechanism for building APIs but we should use it to complement REST APIs instead of using it as a complete replacement. For example, REST may be a better fit for APIs with very few entities and relationships across entities while GraphQL may be appropriate for applications with many different domain objects.
