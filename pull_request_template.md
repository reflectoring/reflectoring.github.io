Please re-read your article a day or so after you finished writing it and work through this checklist to polish the quality. This will save all of us a lot of time during review.

## Content
- [ ] the article explains *why* and not only *how*
- [ ] (half-)sentences that express a meaningful idea that is understandable by itself own are **bold** to allow quick scanning of the text

## Text
- [ ] the text is conversational ("we" instead of "you", easy language)
- [ ] there are no "walls of text" (short sentences, short paragraphs with a single idea)
- [ ] the text is inclusive ("the developers" and "they" instead of "the developer" and "he/she")
- [ ] the text uses active voice instead of passive voice
- [ ] names are spelled consistently throughout the article (correct uppercase / lowercase)
- [ ] file names and variables are highlighted as `code`

## Structure
- [ ] the article has a short intro before the first headline
- [ ] by reading the table of contents (TOC) alone, I get a sense of the "story" of the article (check the TOC in the preview after raising the PR or by starting the blog locally on your machine)
- [ ] if using sub-headlines, there's at least two sub-headlines below a main-headline
- [ ] headlines are consistent throughout the article (same level of abstraction, same style - if one headline starts with a verb in imperative form, the other headlines on the same level should probably, too)

## Code Examples
- [ ] code examples are introduced with a ":" and explained below the code example
- [ ] code examples are formatted to avoid horizontal scrolling (manual line breaks and 2-spaces indentation)
- [ ] the text has been checked with [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) (the free tier is enough)

**Feel free to raise the PR even if the checklist hasn't been worked through, yet**, to take advantage of the preview that is generated for each pull request (see "deploy/netlify" under "Show all checks"). But please only flag it to be reviewed after going through the checklist above.
