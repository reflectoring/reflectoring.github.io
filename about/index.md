The reflectoring blog is all about software engineering tips and tutorials.

The goal is to bring easy-to-digest and actionable tips to you so you can apply
them in your projects.

These tips are largely technology-agnostic so they apply regardless of the tech stack
you're using.

Some tips will be accompanied by separate tutorials based on Java technologies. 

So, if you're a Java developer you have twice the benefit from my blog :).

If you want to get in touch, simply drop an email at <a href="mailto:tom@reflectoring.io">tom@reflectoring.io</a>.

Regards,
Tom
