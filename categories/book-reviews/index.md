description: "Books are my fuel for inspiration and provide ideas to
              write about. Aside from software development books, I also
              like to read books about self-management, psychology and 
              soft skills in general. After each book, I write down a review
              to make it stick in my brain and <strong>to provide you with options
              for your next reading</strong>."
