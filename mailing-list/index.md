**Want to know what's coming before signing up for the mailing list? Here's a peek at the most recent newsletters.**

You'll get an email every week with a link to the latest reflectoring article about Java / Spring / AWS and a short inspirational nugget from me. Sometimes, you'll also get notes from the latest book I've been reading.
