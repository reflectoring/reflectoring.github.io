*"Release early, release often"*. This philosophy should be a goal for every 
software project. Users can only give quality feedback when they have early access
to a software release. And they can only give feedback to new features and
fixes if they have access to the latest version. Releasing often is a major pain
when the release process is not automated. This article is a guide to a fully automated
release chain that is able to publish snapshots and releases from a 
Github repository using Gradle, Bintray and Travis CI.

## The Release Chain 

The following image shows the release chain we're going to build.

{{% image alt="Releasing snapshots and releases from different branches" src="images/posts/fully-automated-open-source-release-chain/git-snapshots-releases.jpg" %}}

In a simplified [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) fashion, we have two branches
in our Git repository:

The **master** branch contains the current state of work. Here, all features and bugfixes
currently being developed come together.

The **release** branch contains only those versions of the codebase that are to be
released.

Additionally, there may be optional **feature** branches in which some features are developed
in isolation. 

**Here's what we're going to automate:**

Each time someone pushes a commit to the master branch (or merges a feature branch into master), **a snapshot will
be published** by our CI pipeline so that users can test the current state of work at any time.

Each time someone pushes a commit to the release branch, **a stable release will
be published** by our CI pipeline so that users can work with the stable version.

Naturally, a snapshot or release will only be published if all tests have run successfully.

## Prerequisites
To create an automated release chain as described in this article, we need
to create a Bintray account and set up a Gradle build as described 
in my previous articles: 

* [Publishing Open Source Releases with Gradle](/guide-publishing-to-bintray-with-gradle/)
* [Publishing Open Source Snapshots with Gradle](/publish-snapshots-with-gradle/)

Once the `build.gradle` file is set up as described in those articles, we're ready to configure 
Travis CI to do the publishing work for us automatically.

## Configure Travis CI
To enable Travis CI, we need to create an account on [https://about.travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com)
and link it to our Github account. 

### Activate 
Once logged into the Travis account, we activate 
Travis CI for the repository we want to publish snapshots and releases for:

{{% image alt="Activate in Travis CI" src="images/posts/fully-automated-open-source-release-chain/travis.png" %}}

### Set Environment Variables

In the settings of the repository on Travis CI, we now set the environment variables
`BINTRAY_KEY` and `BINTRAY_USER` to our Bintray credentials:

{{% image alt="Environment Variables" src="images/posts/fully-automated-open-source-release-chain/travis-env-variables.png" %}} 

### The `.travis.yml` File
Next, we need to put a file called `.travis.yml` into the codebase and push
it to Github. This file contains all configuration for the CI build.

Let's look at the contents of this file. 

#### Basic Setup

```yaml
language: java
install: true

sudo: false
addons:
  apt:
    packages:
      - oracle-java8-installer

before_install:
  - chmod +x gradlew
```

With the `language` property, we tell Travis that it's a Java project.

`install: true` tells Travis that we want to take care of running the Gradle build
ourselves (otherwise Travis runs `gradlew assemble` before each build stage).

We tell Travis to install the `oracle-java8-installer` that in turn takes care of installing
the most current Java 8 JDK.

The last line makes the `gradlew` file executable so that Travis can run it.

#### Declare Build Stages

In the next section of `.travis.yml`, we're making use of Travis CI's [build stages feature](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/)
to divide our build into several steps.

```yaml
stages:
  - name: build
  - name: snapshot
    if: branch = master
  - name: release
    if: branch = release
```  

The **build** stage is going to run the gradle build and check if everything compiles and
all tests are running.

The **snapshot** stage is responsible for publishing a snapshot release and thus should
only run on the master branch.

The **release** stage is responsible for publishing a stable release and thus should
only run on the release branch.
  
#### Define Build Jobs

The last thing left to do now is to configure the actual jobs that should run within
the build stages we declared above:

```yaml
jobs:
  include:
    - stage: build
      script: ./gradlew build
    - stage: snapshot
      script: ./gradlew artifactoryPublish -x test -Dsnapshot=true -Dbintray.user=$BINTRAY_USER -Dbintray.key=$BINTRAY_KEY -Dbuild.number=$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
    - stage: release
      script: ./gradlew bintrayUpload -x test -Dbintray.user=$BINTRAY_USER -Dbintray.key=$BINTRAY_KEY -Dbuild.number=$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
```

In the **build** stage we're simply running our Gradle build. If this stage fails, the other stages
will not be started at all.

In the **snapshot** stage, we're running the `artifactoryPublish` task that takes care of 
publishing the current build as a snapshot to oss.jfrog.org. The details of the Gradle configuration
are explained [here](/publish-snapshots-with-gradle/#set-up-your-buildgradle). 
We pass on the environment variables
`BINTRAY_USER`, `BINTRAY_KEY` and `TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER`, so that the Gradle script can make use of them.

In the **release** stage, we're running the `bintrayUpload` task that takes care of 
publishing a stable release to Bintray, again passing in the necessary environment variables. The details of the Gradle configuration are explained
[here](/guide-publishing-to-bintray-with-gradle/#set-up-your-buildgradle).  

## What now?
And that's it. All in all this is a pretty straightforward way to publish open source
Java projects with Gradle, Bintray and Travis CI.

You can tailor the process to your project as needed. Especially in projects 
maintaining multiple versions at the same time you might have to move toward a 
more complex branching strategy more like the original [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In this case, you would have to add more branches from which snapshots and releases should be published
to the Travis configuration.
