## Why Should We Care About `HTTP` Client?
Have you ever wondered how your favorite apps seamlessly fetch data from the internet or communicate with servers behind the scenes? That's where `HTTP` clients come into play – they're the silent heroes of web communication, doing the heavy lifting so you don't have to.

Imagine you're using a weather app to check the forecast for the day. Behind the scenes, the app sends an `HTTP` request to a weather service's server, asking for the latest weather data. The server processes the request, gathers the relevant information, and sends back an `HTTP` response with the forecast. All of this happens in the blink of an eye, thanks to the magic of `HTTP` clients.

HTTP clients are like digital messengers, facilitating communication between client software and web servers across the internet. They handle all the details of making connection to server, sending `HTTP` requests and processing responses, so you can focus on building great software without getting bogged down in the complexities of web communication.

So why should you care about `HTTP` clients? Well, imagine if every time you wanted to fetch data from a web server or interact with a web service, you had to manually craft and send `HTTP` requests, then parse and handle the responses – it would be a nightmare! `HTTP` clients automate all of that for you, making it easy to send and receive data over the web with just a few lines of code.

Whether you're building a mobile app, a web service, or anything in between, `HTTP` clients are essential tools for interacting with the vast digital landscape of the internet. So the next time you're building software that needs to communicate over the web, remember to tip your hat to the humble `HTTP` client – they're the unsung heroes of web development!

## Brief Overview of Apache `HTTP` Client
Apache HttpClient is a powerful Java library that excels at sending `HTTP` requests and handling `HTTP` responses. It has gained popularity due to its open-source nature and its rich set of features that align with the latest `HTTP` standards.

One of the key strengths of Apache HttpClient is its support for various authentication mechanisms, allowing developers to easily integrate secure authentication into their applications. Additionally, the library offers connection pooling, which can greatly enhance performance by reusing existing connections instead of establishing new ones.

Another notable feature of Apache HttpClient is its ability to intercept requests and responses. This enables developers to modify or inspect the data being sent or received, providing flexibility and control over the communication process.

Furthermore, Apache HttpClient offers seamless integration with other Apache libraries, making it a versatile tool for Java developers. It also provides robust support for the fundamental `HTTP` methods, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of web services.

## Why Should We Use Apache `HTTP` Client for `HTTP` Requests?
Apache HttpClient is often preferred over other Java `HTTP` clients for several reasons:

Apache HttpClient is highly regarded for its reliability and resilience in HTTP communication. It has a strong reputation for stability and robustness, making it the preferred choice for critical applications that require reliability.

One of its notable features is its wide range of functionalities that cater to various needs in the HTTP ecosystem. It supports multiple HTTP methods, offers secure authentication mechanisms, connection pooling, and advanced request and response handling capabilities. Apache HttpClient is a comprehensive solution for effectively managing HTTP interactions.

What sets Apache HttpClient apart is its flexibility and adaptability. Developers can customize its functionality to meet their specific requirements due to its extensible architecture. The framework allows for the integration of various components such as connection managers, request and response interceptors, and authentication schemes, enabling developers to tailor their HTTP interactions effortlessly.

As a part of the Apache Software Foundation, Apache HttpClient thrives within a supportive community. It receives continuous support, documentation, and development from a vibrant ecosystem of developers and users. This ensures that it remains up-to-date and relevant in an ever-changing landscape.

Furthermore, Apache HttpClient is committed to backward compatibility, making it easier for existing applications to upgrade. By maintaining compatibility with older versions, it minimizes the need for major code changes, facilitating seamless upgrades and long-term maintenance of applications.

Overall, Apache HttpClient is a mature and reliable `HTTP` client library that offers a rich set of features, flexibility, and community support, making it a top choice for Java developers.

## Getting Familiar With Useful Terms of Apache HttpClient
In the domain of Apache HTTP client, lot of terms are essential for comprehending the functionality of this robust tool. At its core lies the `CloseableHttpClient`, a vital component that manages connections to HTTP servers. Think of it as the guardian of communication, ensuring seamless and secure data exchanges between your application and web resources.

As your application makes interactions with the vast realm of the internet, it encounters `HttpResponse`, a capsule of information that sheds light on the outcome of each interaction. This response unlocks the server's message, whether it signifies success, error, or redirection.

`HttpResponse` comes with its counterpart, `CloseableHttpResponse`, a trusted ally on the journey. Like a reliable guide, it not only conveys the server's response but also ensures that connections are gracefully closed after use, preventing resource leaks and enhancing performance.

As our exploration progresses, we come across `Headers`, tiny snippets of metadata that accompany every HTTP request and response. These headers contain valuable details like content type, encoding, and authentication tokens, facilitating the exchange of data between client and server.

In the dynamic world of web servers, we put to use `HttpHost`. It encapsulates the server's host name and port number, acting as a navigational aid for our HTTP requests.

A journey through Apache HTTP client would be incomplete without encountering `HttpEntity`, the carrier that transports data across the servers. Whether it's text, binary, or streaming content, `HttpEntity` offers a unified interface for managing data payloads effortlessly.

In our pursuit of knowledge, we come across a variety of specialized tools called HTTP methods, each serving a distinct purpose. From `HttpGet` for retrieving data to `HttpPost` for creating new resources, and `HttpPut` for updating existing ones, these methods empower us to engage with web resources effectively.

In upcoming articles in this series, we are going to learn how to implement our web interactions using these terms.

## Conclusion
Apache HTTP Client simplifies HTTP communication in Java applications. With intuitive APIs, it enables developers to perform various HTTP operations, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. Offering flexibility and robustness, it facilitates seamless integration with web services, making it ideal for building web applications, RESTful APIs, and micro-services. Whether fetching data from external APIs or interacting with web resources, Apache HTTP Client provides a reliable solution for handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently. Its extensive features, along with easy-to-use interfaces, make it a preferred choice for developers seeking a powerful and versatile HTTP client library in their Java projects.

Apache HTTP client offers classic (synchronous or blocking), asynchronous and reactive APIs. In the upcoming articles of this series, we would learn about these APIs.
