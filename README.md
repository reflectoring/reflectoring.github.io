# Contribute
If you have an idea for a blog post or want to write a post to one of the existing ideas in the issue tracker,
feel free to get in touch. Here's how we work:
* For each month, we create a task board (see Projects tab) that contains the blog posts and other tasks that we want to finish within that month.
* We meet once a month to sort tasks into the upcoming months' boards and review the tasks of the previous month.
* For each task, an issue in the issue tracker is created. Always include the issue number in your commits as described here: https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/
* All tasks are proposed to the team as pull requests (PRs) which are reviewed using the Github features and then merged. The repo is not modified directly.
* If you have proposed a PR, put the ticket you were working on into the "Review" column of the task board and remove yourself as assignee.
* If you have reviewed a PR and want changes, move the ticket back into the "In Progress" column.
* If you have reviewed a PR successfully, merge it and close the ticket (if it is not closed automatically).
