Hi, I'm Tom, and I run the reflectoring blog. 

I'm a software developer, consultant, architect, coach ... whatever the role, I'm
focused on getting software ready for production.

Every day, I'm confronted with new problems to solve and new ideas to follow up on.
This blog is a place for those solutions and ideas, so that you (and future me) get
a head start the next time we have to solve a problem.

With this blog, I produce:

 * deep-dive tutorials about [Spring Boot](/categories/spring-boot)
 * hands-on tutorials about [Java](/categories/java)
 * opinion on practices of the [Software Craft](/categories/software-craft)
 * [book reviews](/categories/book-reviews) of the (non-fiction) books I've read.

If you're interested in working with me or have any feedback about my writing, don't hesitate to contact me.
