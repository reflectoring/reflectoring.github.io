## Spring Configuration: Demystifying the Heartbeat of Spring Applications

In the vibrant landscape of software development, Spring Configuration stands as the silent orchestrator, harmonizing the elements of Spring applications. At its core, **Spring Configuration is the art and science of setting up a Spring application, defining its components, managing dependencies, and orchestrating their interactions**. It serves as the blueprint, guiding the behavior of our Spring-powered creations.

Configuration in Spring is all about empowering our applications with context, specifying how beans (Spring-managed objects) are created, wired, and used within the application.

Traditionally, Spring offered XML-based configuration, providing a structured way to define beans and their relationships. In the dynamic landscape of Java and Spring, XML configurations have been replaced by more intuitive, expressive, and Java-centric approaches, showcasing the superior efficiency of Java configuration.

## What Makes Spring Configuration Essential?

Java-based configuration in Spring is like poetry in code, where you harness the power of plain Java classes and annotations to configure our application. With Java-based configuration, you bid farewell to XML files and embrace the elegance of Java code to define our beans and their relationships.

In the upcoming sections, we will unravel the intricacies of Spring's Java Configuration, exploring its core concepts, understanding annotations like `@Bean` and `@Configuration`, and delving into the art of organizing and managing our Spring applications.

Let's embark on this journey to demystify Spring's heartbeat and empower our coding endeavors.

{{% info title="Notes: Understanding Beans in Spring Applications" %}}

Excited to dive into the magic of Spring? Let's recap the essentials: beans, IoC, and DI. Join us on this empowering journey, making our Java applications thrive!

‚úç **BEANS: THE CORE OF SPRING:**
In the world of Spring, a 'bean' is not just a legume but the fundamental building block of our application. **Beans are Java objects managed by the Spring container.** Think of them as the essential ingredients in a recipe, representing the various components of our application, from simple data objects to complex business logic. **Spring takes care of creating these beans, managing their lifecycle, and wiring them together, making our application cohesive and organized.**

‚úç **INVERSION OF CONTROL (IOC) SIMPLIFIED:**
IoC, often referred to as the 'heart' of Spring, is a concept where the control over the object creation and lifecycle is transferred from our application to the Spring container. Imagine our application as a passenger in a self-driving car; you specify the destination, and Spring takes care of the driving, ensuring **our beans are created, configured, and managed without our direct intervention**.

‚úç **DEPENDENCY INJECTION (DI) UNVEILED:**
Dependency Injection is like a magic potion in Spring. It's the process where beans receive their dependencies from an external source, typically the Spring container, rather than creating them internally. Picture a chef receiving all the ingredients pre-chopped and organized on the kitchen counter. With DI, our beans are ready to use, making our code cleaner, more modular, and easier to test. **Spring handles the 'injection' of dependencies, ensuring our beans work seamlessly together in our application recipe.**

## Understanding Core Concepts: @Bean and @Configuration

{{% info title="Use Case: Employee Management System" %}}
Imagine you're building an Employee Management System, where employees belong to various departments within a company. In this intricate ecosystem, maintaining clean code and modular architecture is crucial.

Feel free to refer to example code shared on [Github](#example-code).

{{% /info %}}
\
Enter Spring's core concepts: `@Bean` and `@Configuration`.

**Understanding @Bean:**
In Spring, `@Bean` is a magic wand that transforms ordinary methods into Spring-managed beans. These beans are objects managed by the Spring IoC container, ensuring centralized control and easier dependency management. In our Employee Management System, `@Bean` helps create beans representing employees and departments.

```java
public class Employee {
    // Employee properties and methods
}

public class Department {
    // Department properties and methods
}

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "io.reflectoring.javaconfig")
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "newEmployee", initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "destroy")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    @Cacheable(cacheNames = "employeesCache")
    public Employee newEmployee(final String firstName, final String lastName) {
        return Employee.builder().firstName(firstName).lastName(lastName).build();
    }

    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Department newDepartment(final String deptName) {
        final Department department = Department.builder().name(deptName).build();
        acme().addDepartment(department);
        return department;
    }

    @Bean(name = "founder")
    @Qualifier(value = "founder")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Employee founderEmployee() {
        final Employee founder = newEmployee("Scott", "Tiger");
        founder.setDesignation("Founder");
        founder.setDepartment(coreDepartment());
        return founder;
    }

    @Bean(name = "core")
    @Qualifier(value = "core")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Department coreDepartment() {
        return newDepartment("Core");
    }

    @Bean(name = "acme")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    @Qualifier(value = "acme")
    public Organization acme() {
        final Organization acmeCo = new Organization();
        acmeCo.setName("Acme Inc");
        return acmeCo;
    }
}
```

Here, the `newEmployee` and `founderEmployee` methods create an `Employee` bean, `newDepartment` and `coreDepartment` methods create a `Department` bean and `acme` method creats an `Organization` bean. Spring now manages these objects, handling their lifecycle and ensuring proper dependencies.

**Understanding Bean Lifecycle:**

The lifecycle of a Spring bean involves its instantiation, initialization, use, and eventual disposal. When the Spring container starts, it instantiates the beans. Then, it injects the dependencies, calls the initialization methods (if specified), and makes the bean available for use. When the container shuts down, the beans are destroyed, invoking any destruction methods (if defined).

{{% info title="Spring Bean Lifecycle: A Summary" %}}

Spring beans, the heart of Spring applications, undergo a series of stages known as the bean lifecycle. Understanding these stages is essential for effective bean management.

Here‚Äôs a concise summary of the Spring bean lifecycle methods:

1. **Instantiation:** Beans are created, either through constructor invocation or factory methods.

2. **Population of Properties:** Dependencies and properties of the bean are set.

3. **Awareness:** Beans implementing `Aware` interfaces are notified of the Spring environment and related beans. Examples include `BeanNameAware`, `BeanFactoryAware`, and `ApplicationContextAware`.

4. **Initialization:** The bean is initialized after its properties are set. This involves calling custom initialization methods specified by the developer. If a bean implements the `InitializingBean` interface, the `afterPropertiesSet()` method is invoked. Alternatively, you can define a custom initialization method and specify it in the bean configuration.

5. **In Use:** The bean is now in use, performing its intended functions within the application.

6. **Destruction:** When the application context is closed or the bean is no longer needed, the destruction phase begins. Beans can implement the `DisposableBean` interface to define custom cleanup operations in the `destroy()` method. Alternatively, you can specify a custom destruction method in the bean configuration.

Understanding these stages ensures proper initialization and cleanup of Spring beans, facilitating efficient and well-managed Spring applications.

üëâ Unveil the secrets of bean lifecycle in [our detailed article](https://reflectoring.io/spring-bean-lifecycle/).

{{% /info %}}
\
**Managing Spring Bean Lifecycle with @Bean:**

In the context of the Employee Management System, let‚Äôs delve deeper into managing the lifecycle of a Spring bean using `@Bean` methods and related annotations.

**1. Custom Initialization and Destruction Methods:**

```java
public class Employee {

    // Bean properties and methods

    public void init() {
        // Custom initialization logic
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Custom cleanup logic
    }
}
```

In our configuration class:

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "newEmployee", initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "destroy")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    @Cacheable(cacheNames = "employeesCache")
    public Employee newEmployee(final String firstName, final String lastName) {
        return Employee.builder().firstName(firstName).lastName(lastName).build();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `newEmployee` method creates an `Employee` bean. The `initMethod` attribute specifies a custom initialization method, and the `destroyMethod` attribute defines a custom cleanup method. When the bean is created and destroyed, these methods are invoked, allowing you to handle specific lifecycle events.

**2. Implementing InitializingBean and DisposableBean Interfaces:**

```java

public class Department implements InitializingBean, DisposableBean {

    // Bean properties and methods

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        // Initialization logic
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() throws Exception {
        // Cleanup logic
    }
}
```

In our configuration class, you can create the bean as usual:

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

     @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Department newDepartment(final String deptName) {
        final Department department = Department.builder().name(deptName).build();
        acme().addDepartment(department);
        return department;
    }
}
```

In this approach, the `Department` class implements the `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces, providing `afterPropertiesSet()` for initialization and `destroy()` for cleanup. Spring automatically detects these interfaces and calls the appropriate methods during bean lifecycle stages.

Interface `InitializingBean` is implemented by beans that need to react once all their properties have been set by a `BeanFactory`: for example, to perform custom initialization, or merely to check that all mandatory properties have been set.

Interface `DisposableBean` is implemented by beans that want to release resources on destruction. A `BeanFactory` is supposed to invoke the destroy method if it disposes a cached singleton. An application context is supposed to dispose all of its singletons on close.

These examples demonstrate how `@Bean` methods, along with custom initialization and destruction methods or interfaces like `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean`, enable precise control over the lifecycle of Spring beans within our Employee Management System.

**Specifying Bean Scope:**
The `@Scope` annotation allows you to define the scope of the bean. For instance, `@Scope("prototype")` indicates a new instance of the bean for every request, while the default scope is `Singleton`, creating a single bean instance per Spring IoC container.

```java
@Configuration
public class EmployeeConfig {

    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Employee employee() {
        return new Employee();
    }
}
```
{{% info title="Summary of Spring Bean Scopes" %}}
In Spring, bean scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean instance within the Spring IoC container. Choosing the right scope ensures appropriate management and usage of beans in our application. Here‚Äôs a summary of common Spring bean scopes:

1. **Singleton Scope:** Beans in Singleton scope have a single instance per Spring IoC container. It's the default scope. Singleton beans are created once and shared across the application. Use this scope for stateless beans and heavy objects to conserve resources.

2. **Prototype Scope:** Beans in Prototype scope have a new instance every time they are requested. Each request for a prototype bean creates a new object. Use this scope for stateful beans or when you need a new instance every time.

3. **Request Scope:** Beans in Request scope have a single instance per HTTP request. This scope is specific to web applications. Each HTTP request gets a new instance of the bean. Use this for stateful beans in a web context.

4. **Session Scope:** Beans in Session scope have a single instance per HTTP session. Similar to request scope but persists across multiple requests within the same session. Use this for user-specific stateful beans in a web context.

5. **Application Scope:** Beans in Application scope have a single instance per ServletContext. This means a single instance shared across all users/sessions in a web application. Use this for global, stateless beans that should be shared by all users.

6. **Custom Scope:** Besides the standard scopes, Spring allows you to create custom scopes tailored to specific requirements. Custom scopes can range from narrow scopes like thread scope to broader scopes based on business logic.

Choosing the appropriate scope depends on the specific use case and requirements of our beans. Understanding these scopes ensures that our beans are managed effectively, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring the correct behavior of our Spring application.
{{% /info %}}
\
**Overriding Default Bean Name:**
By default, the bean name is the same as the method name. However, you can specify a custom name using the name attribute in the `@Bean` annotation.

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "founder")
    @Qualifier(value = "founder")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Employee founderEmployee() {
        final Employee founder = newEmployee("Scott", "Tiger");
        founder.setDesignation("Founder");
        founder.setDepartment(coreDepartment());
        return founder;
    }
}
```

In this example, the bean is named `founder`, allowing specific identification within the application context.

Understanding `@Bean` and its related concepts is pivotal in Spring configuration. It not only creates instances but also allows fine-grained control over their lifecycle, scope, and naming conventions, empowering our Employee Management System with robust, Spring-managed components.

**Understanding @Configuration:**
`@Configuration` is a superhero annotation that marks a class as a source of bean definitions. It allows you to create beans using `@Bean` methods within the class. In our Employee Management System, `@Configuration` organizes the creation of beans, providing a centralized configuration hub.

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public Employee employee() {
        return new Employee();
    }

    @Bean
    public Department salesDepartment() {
        return new Department();
    }
}
```

With `@Configuration`, you encapsulate our bean definitions, promoting modularity and enhancing maintainability. Spring ensures that these beans are available for injection wherever needed, making our Employee Management System robust and scalable.

**Concrete Examples for @Bean and @Configuration**

**1. Database Configuration with DataSource:**

In a RESTful Employee Management System, configuring a database connection is critical. `@Configuration` can be used to set up the data source, ensuring seamless communication with your database.

Here's an example of configuring an H2 database as a data source using Java configuration in Spring:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "io.reflectoring.javaconfig")
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
public class DatabaseConfiguration {
    @Value("${spring.datasource.driver-class-name}")
    private String databaseClass;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.url}")
    private String databaseUrl;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.username}")
    private String username;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.password}")
    private String password;

    @Bean(name = "employee-management-db")
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        final DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setDriverClassName(databaseClass);
        dataSource.setUrl(databaseUrl); // H2 in-memory database URL
        dataSource.setUsername(username); // Default H2 username (sa)
        dataSource.setPassword(password); // Default H2 password (sa)

        return dataSource;
    }

}
```

In this configuration, the `DriverManagerDataSource` bean is created, specifying the H2 database driver class name, `URL` for an in-memory database (`jdbc:h2:mem:employee_management_db`), default H2 username (`sa`), and password (`sa`). You can modify the URL to connect to a file-based H2 database or other configurations based on your specific use case.

Remember to add the necessary H2 database dependency in your project's build file (Maven or Gradle) if you haven't already.
See the pom.xml in the example code shared on [Github](#example-code).

**2. Caching Configuration with EhCache:**

Efficient data caching is vital for improving response times in RESTful applications. `@Configuration` can be utilized to set up caching mechanisms, enhancing the system‚Äôs performance.

In the configuration class we include the `@EnableCaching` annotation to enable caching for the entire application:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class AppCacheConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "employees-cache")
    public CacheManager employeesCacheManager() {
        final CacheManager manager = CacheManager.create();

        //Create a Cache specifying its configuration.
        final Cache employeesCache = new Cache(
            new CacheConfiguration("employeesCache", 1000)
                .memoryStoreEvictionPolicy(MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy.LFU)
                .eternal(false)
                .timeToLiveSeconds(60)
                .timeToIdleSeconds(30)
                .diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds(0)
                .persistence(
                    new PersistenceConfiguration()
                        .strategy(PersistenceConfiguration.Strategy.LOCALTEMPSWAP)));
        manager.addCache(employeesCache);
        return manager;
    }
}
```

By adding `@EnableCaching` to the configuration class, we activate caching support globally.

In this example, `@Configuration` sets up caching using EhCache, creating a cache named "employeesCache" that expires after an hour. This enhances the application‚Äôs responsiveness by reducing database queries.

üëâ You can learn caching in detail by going through our article [Implementing a Cache with Spring Boot](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-cache/).

**3. Security Configuration with Spring Security:**

Securing your Employee Management System is paramount. `@Configuration` can be used to configure Spring Security, ensuring that your endpoints are protected.

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean("http-security")
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -> authorize
                .requestMatchers("/employees/**").hasAuthority("USER")
                .requestMatchers("/departments/**").hasAuthority("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers("/organizations/**").hasAuthority("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            );
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

Let's break down the code:

1. `public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception`: This method defines a custom `SecurityFilterChain` and takes an `HttpSecurity` object as a parameter.
1. `.authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -> authorize`: The `authorizeHttpRequests()` method is called on the `http` object, allowing authorization configuration. It takes a lambda expression that provides an `AuthorizationRequestBuilder` for specifying access rules.
1. `.requestMatchers("/employees/**").hasAuthority("USER")`: This line configures an access rule. It specifies that requests matching the "/employees/\*\*" pattern should have the "USER" authority to be allowed access. Access control is based on authorities granted to the user.
1. `.requestMatchers("/departments/**").hasAuthority("ADMIN")`: Similar to the previous line, this configures another access rule for the "/departments/\*\*" pattern, allowing access only to users with the "ADMIN" authority.
1. `.requestMatchers("/organizations/**").hasAuthority("ADMIN")`: Another access rule for the "/organizations/\*\*" pattern, restricting access to users with the "ADMIN" authority.
1. `.anyRequest().authenticated()`:  This line specifies that any other requests not matching the specified patterns should be authenticated, meaning the user must be logged in to access those resources.
1. `return http.build()`: Finally, the `http.build()` method is called to build and return the configured `SecurityFilterChain`.

In summary, this configuration enforces access control based on the URL patterns. Requests to "/employees/" require the "USER" authority, requests to "/departments/" and "/organizations/\*\*" require the "ADMIN" authority, and any other requests require authentication. This provides fine-grained access control to different parts of the application based on the user's authorities.

These advanced examples demonstrate the power of `@Bean` and `@Configuration` in configuring complex components such as database connections, caching mechanisms, and security protocols within a RESTful Employee Management System.

In the intricate world of employee management, `@Bean` and `@Configuration` shine as the building blocks, simplifying complexity and ensuring our Spring application runs seamlessly. Harness their power, and watch our application flourish.

## Unraveling the Mystery of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` is a class in the Spring Framework that allows you to create an application context by registering annotated classes as configuration sources. It's particularly useful when you are working with Java-based configuration instead of XML configuration.

Here's how it is commonly used and its primary purposes:

1. **Java-Based Configuration:**
   - **No XML Required:** With `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`, you can configure your Spring beans and components using Java classes instead of XML files. This approach is often preferred because it provides type safety, refactoring support, and improved readability.

2. **Annotation Scanning:**
   - **Component Scanning:** The `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` automatically scans packages for classes annotated with Spring annotations such as `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Configuration`. It registers these annotated classes as Spring beans in the application context.
  
3. **Using Java Configuration Classes:**
   - **`@Configuration` Annotated Classes:** You can use classes annotated with `@Configuration` to define your beans and their dependencies. The methods within these classes annotated with `@Bean` define individual beans. `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` allows you to utilize these configuration classes directly.

4. **Integration with Spring Annotations:**
   - **`@Autowired` and Other Annotations:** You can use `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` in conjunction with annotations like `@Autowired` to wire up dependencies. Spring resolves these annotations and injects the appropriate beans into the classes that require them.

5. **Programmatic Bean Registration:**
   - **Manual Bean Registration:** Apart from component scanning and `@Bean` methods, you can also manually register beans in the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`. This is particularly useful when you want fine-grained control over bean creation and lifecycle.

6. **Type Safety and IDE Support:**
   - **Refactoring Support:** Since the configuration is done using Java classes and annotations, you get strong type checking and refactoring support from modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). This makes it easier to manage and refactor your codebase.

**Example Usage:**

Here's an example of how you might use `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "io.reflectoring.javaconfig")
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {
    // Configuration and bean definitions using @Bean methods
}

public class JavaConfigApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context 
            = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(JavaConfigAppConfiguration.class);
        
        // Now you can access beans from the context
        final Employee newEmployee 
            = context.getBean("newEmployee", Employee.class);
        
        // ...
        
        // Close the context when the application is shutting down
        context.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, `JavaConfigAppConfiguration` is a Java configuration class with `@Configuration` and `@ComponentScan` annotations. The `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` is instantiated with `JavaConfigAppConfiguration.class` as an argument, allowing it to scan the specified packages for annotated components and register them in the application context. You can then retrieve beans from the context and use them in your application.

{{% info title="Component Scanning in Spring" %}}

Component scanning is a powerful feature in Spring that allows the framework to automatically discover and register Spring components, such as beans, within your application context. Instead of manually defining each bean in your configuration, you can rely on component scanning to find classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` (or their meta-annotations) and register them as Spring beans.

**Key Points:**

1. **Automatic Bean Detection:** Spring's component scanning automatically identifies classes annotated with specific stereotype annotations. For instance, a class annotated with `@Component` is automatically registered as a Spring bean.

2. **Base Packages:** You can specify one or more base packages for component scanning. Spring searches for annotated components within these packages and their sub-packages. This allows for fine-grained control over which parts of your application are scanned.

3. **Stereotype Annotations:** Component scanning works with stereotype annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`. These annotations enable clear categorization of components and are used to define different roles within the application.

4. **Custom Stereotype Annotations:** In addition to the standard Spring stereotypes, you can create custom stereotype annotations using the `@Component` meta-annotation. This allows you to define your own annotations with specific semantics and behavior.

5. **Annotation Meta-Attributes:** Annotations like `@ComponentScan` provide meta-attributes such as `basePackages`, `basePackageClasses`, and `includeFilters`. These attributes allow you to fine-tune the component scanning process, specifying exactly which classes should be considered as Spring components.

6. **Reduced Configuration:** Component scanning significantly reduces configuration overhead. Instead of listing every bean in a configuration file, you can rely on sensible defaults and conventions. This promotes cleaner, more concise configurations.

7. **Ease of Maintenance:** When new components are added or existing ones are refactored, there's no need to update the configuration manually. Component scanning ensures that Spring stays up-to-date with the components in your application.

By leveraging component scanning, developers can focus on writing business logic and structuring their application naturally, allowing Spring to handle the bean registration process automatically. This results in more maintainable, scalable, and readable Spring applications.

## Building Scalable Applications

In the realm of Spring applications, scalability and maintainability are key considerations. As applications grow, it becomes essential to structure the configuration in a way that's modular and adaptable. Java-based configuration in Spring provides a robust solution, enabling the development of scalable applications through modular configurations.

**Modular Configurations: The Power of Java Classes**

**1. Organizing Configuration Logic:**
   - **Java Classes as Configuration Units:** With Java-based configuration, each Java class can encapsulate a specific set of configuration concerns. For instance, one class can handle data source configuration, another can manage security, and yet another can configure caching mechanisms.
   - **Encapsulation and Cohesion:** Each class focuses on a particular aspect of the application's configuration, promoting encapsulation and ensuring high cohesion, making the codebase more comprehensible and maintainable.

**2. Reusability and Composition:**
   - **Reusable Configurations:** Java configuration classes are highly reusable. A configuration class developed for one module can often be employed in other parts of the application or even in different projects, fostering a culture of code reuse.
   - **Composing Configurations:** By composing multiple configuration classes together, developers can create complex configurations from simpler, well-defined building blocks. This composition simplifies management and promotes a modular architecture.
   ```java
       @Configuration
       @Import({DatabaseConfiguration.class, 
                AppCacheConfiguration.class,
                SecurityConfiguration.class})
       public class InfrastructureConfiguration {
       }
       
   ```
   In this example:

`@Import` Annotation: The `InfrastructureConfiguration` class uses the `@Import` annotation to import the configuration classes of individual modules. This annotation allows us to compose configurations by combining multiple configuration classes into a single configuration class.

By importing the `SecurityConfiguration`, `DatabaseConfiguration`, and `AppCacheConfiguration` classes into the `InfrastructureConfiguration`, we create a unified configuration that encompasses all the specific settings for authentication, database interactions, and caching.

**3. Configuration Profiles for Flexibility:**
   - **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Java-based configuration allows the use of different profiles for various environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Each profile can have its own set of configuration classes, ensuring adaptability and flexibility across deployment scenarios.
   - **Dynamic Bean Creation:** Conditional logic within configuration classes allows dynamic bean creation based on the active profile, enabling applications to adjust their behavior at runtime.

**4. Testing and Unit Testing Advantages:**
   - **Isolated Testing:** Each configuration class can be unit-tested in isolation, ensuring that specific functionalities are correctly configured.
   - **Mocking Dependencies:** In testing, dependencies can be easily mocked, enabling focused testing of individual configuration components without relying on complex setups.

**5. Clear Hierarchical Structure:**
   - **Hierarchical Structure:** Java configuration fosters a clear hierarchical structure within the application, where configurations can be organized based on layers, modules, or features.
   - **Enhanced Readability:** The hierarchical arrangement enhances the readability of the configuration code, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the application's structure.


Java-based configuration in Spring empowers developers to create highly scalable and maintainable applications. By embracing modular configurations, developers can build flexible, adaptable systems that respond effectively to changing requirements. With encapsulation, reusability, and focused testing, Java-based configuration stands as a cornerstone for building robust and scalable Spring applications, ensuring they are not only powerful today but also adaptable for tomorrow's challenges.

## Tailoring Configurations with Profiles

In real-world applications, the same codebase often needs to adapt to various deployment environments, development stages, or specific use cases. Spring provides a powerful mechanism called **Profiles** to handle these different scenarios. Profiles enable developers to customize configurations based on the environment, allowing for seamless transitions between development, testing, and production environments.

**1. Understanding Spring Profiles:**
   - **Defining Profiles:** Spring profiles are defined using `@Profile` annotation on beans or configuration classes, indicating which profiles they are active for.
   - **Activation:** Profiles can be activated through various means, such as environment properties, system properties, or servlet context parameters.

**2. Creating Profile-Specific Configurations:**
   - **Profile-Specific Beans:** Define beans specific to a profile. For example, a development database configuration bean might differ from the production configuration.
   - **Conditional Logic:** Use `@Profile` in conjunction with `@Bean` methods to conditionally create beans based on the active profiles.

**3. Environment-Specific Property Files:**
   - **Property Files:** Utilize different property files for different profiles. Spring can load environment-specific property files based on the active profile, allowing configuration values to vary.
   - **YAML Configuration:** Alternatively, use YAML files with profile-specific blocks, enabling a clean separation of configuration properties for each profile.

**4. Switching Profiles:**
   - **In Application Properties:** Set the `spring.profiles.active` property in `application.properties` or `application.yml` to specify the active profiles.
   - **Using Environment Variables:** Profiles can also be activated using environment variables or command-line arguments when starting the application.

**5. Practical Use Cases:**
   - **Development vs. Production:** Tailor logging levels, database connections, and external service endpoints to match development or production environments.
   - **Testing Scenarios:** Customize configurations for various test scenarios, ensuring accurate and isolated testing of different application features.
   - **Integration vs. Unit Testing:** Adjust configurations to mock external dependencies during unit tests while integrating with actual services during integration tests.

**6. Advantages of Profiles:**
   - **Flexibility:** Profiles provide a flexible way to manage configurations for different scenarios without altering the core codebase.
   - **Consistency:** By ensuring consistent configurations within each environment, profiles promote stability and predictability in different stages of the application's lifecycle.
   - **Simplified Deployment:** Easily switch between profiles during deployment, allowing the same artifact to adapt to diverse runtime environments.

**7. Conclusion: Adaptable and Scalable Configurations:**
   Spring profiles empower developers to create applications that can seamlessly adapt to diverse deployment environments. By tailoring configurations with profiles, applications become more adaptable, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring a consistent and reliable experience across various scenarios. Utilizing profiles effectively is a key practice in creating robust, environment-aware Spring applications.
 
üëâ **Caution:** Not all scenarios benefit from Spring profiles. Ensure you understand the nuances. For detailed insights, refer to our article on [when and when not to use profiles in Spring applications](https://reflectoring.io/dont-use-spring-profile-annotation/).

## Streamlining Java Configuration

In the world of Spring Boot, `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is a powerful annotation that simplifies the process of configuring your Spring application. When you annotate your main application class with `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, you're essentially telling Spring Boot to automatically configure your application based on the libraries, dependencies, and components it finds in the classpath.

**1. Automatic Configuration:**
   - **Dependency Analysis:** Spring Boot analyzes your classpath to identify the libraries and components you're using.
   - **Smart Defaults:** It then automatically configures beans, components, and other settings, providing sensible default behaviors.
   
Spring Boot automatically configures essential components like the web server, database connection, and more based on your classpath and the libraries you include.

Example: Minimal Application with Auto-Configuration:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class JavaConfigApplication {

}
```
In this example, `@SpringBootApplication` includes `@EnableAutoConfiguration`. This annotation signals Spring Boot to configure the application automatically, setting up defaults based on the classpath.

**2. Customization and Overrides:**
   - **Selective Overrides:** While Spring Boot provides auto-configuration, you can still customize and override these configurations as needed.
   - **Properties-Based Tuning:** Properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml` can fine-tune auto-configured settings.

You can customize auto-configurations using properties. For instance, you can disable a specific auto-configuration by setting a property.

Example: Disabling a Specific Auto-Configuration:
```properties
# application.properties
spring.autoconfigure.exclude=\
    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration
```
In this example, DataSourceAutoConfiguration is explicitly excluded, meaning Spring Boot won't configure a datasource bean by default.

**3. Simplified Setup:**
   - **Reduced Boilerplate:** `@EnableAutoConfiguration` drastically reduces boilerplate code, eliminating the need for explicit configuration for many common scenarios.
   - **Rapid Prototyping:** It allows developers to quickly prototype and build applications without getting bogged down in intricate configuration details.

With auto-configuration, you can rapidly prototype applications without extensive configuration.

Example: Creating a REST Controller:
```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```
In this example, a simple REST endpoint is created without explicit configuration. Spring Boot's auto-configuration handles the setup, allowing developers to focus on the business logic.

Spring Boot's auto-configuration simplifies `@RestController` development. It handles `HTTP` message conversion, request mapping, and exception handling. Developers can focus on business logic while Spring Boot manages content negotiation and routing, streamlining RESTful API creation with sensible defaults and minimizing manual configuration.

In the context of a `@RestController`, Spring Boot offers several auto-configurations that simplify the setup and handling of RESTful endpoints. These auto-configurations are part of Spring Boot's opinionated defaults, allowing developers to quickly create REST APIs without having to configure everything manually.

Here's what Spring Boot provides in terms of auto-configuration for a `@RestController`:

1. HTTP Message Conversion:

Spring Boot automatically configures message converters to handle the conversion between Java objects and `JSON` (and other media types). When your controller returns an object, Spring Boot automatically serializes it to `JSON` using libraries like Jackson.

Example:

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
        // Automatically converted to JSON
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Hello, Spring Boot!");
    }
}
```

2. Request Mapping and Dispatching:

Spring Boot sets up default request mappings and dispatcher servlet configurations. It automatically maps incoming `HTTP` requests to the appropriate controller methods based on the `@RequestMapping` or related annotations.

Example:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
        // Maps to /api/hello
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Hello, Spring Boot!");
    }
}
```

3. Exception Handling:

Spring Boot provides default exception handling, mapping exceptions to appropriate `HTTP` status codes and error responses. For example, if a method throws an exception, Spring Boot automatically generates a `500` `Internal Server Error` response.

Example:

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
        // Some logic that might throw an exception
        throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!");
    }
}
```

In this case, Spring Boot would automatically handle the exception and send a `500` `Internal Server Error` response to the client.

4. Content Negotiation

Spring Boot automatically handles content negotiation based on the `Accept` header of the incoming `HTTP` request. It can produce responses in various formats, such as `JSON` or `XML`, based on the client's preference.

Example

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping(value = "/hello", 
                produces = { MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE, 
                             MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE })
    public ResponseEntity<String> hello() {
        // Automatically negotiates response format
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Hello, Spring Boot!");
    }
}
```

These auto-configurations simplify the development of RESTful APIs in Spring Boot. Developers can focus on business logic and endpoint functionality, relying on Spring Boot to handle the underlying HTTP-related configurations and concerns. This opinionated approach enables rapid development and consistent API behavior across Spring Boot applications.

**4. Conditional Configuration:**
   - **Conditional Loading:** Auto-configuration is conditional; it's applied only if certain conditions are met.
   - **@ConditionalOnClass and @ConditionalOnProperty:** Conditions can be based on the presence of specific classes or properties, giving you fine-grained control.

Auto-configurations are conditionally applied based on specific conditions.

Example: Conditional Bean Creation:
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Conditional;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    @Conditional(MyCondition.class)
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```
In this example, MyBean is created only if the condition specified by MyCondition is met. Conditional annotations are integral to Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.

**5. Intuitive Development:**
   - **Faster Development:** With auto-configuration, developers can focus more on business logic and features, accelerating development cycles.
   - **Convention Over Configuration:** It follows the convention over configuration principle, encouraging consistency across Spring Boot applications.

Auto-configuration simplifies the development process and promotes convention over configuration.

Example: Spring Boot Starter Usage:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
In this example, including the spring-boot-starter-web dependency automatically configures the application for web development. Spring Boot starters encapsulate auto-configurations, providing an intuitive way to include essential dependencies.

**6. Spring Boot Starter Packs:**
   - **Starter Packs:** Spring Boot Starter Packs are built around auto-configuration, bundling essential dependencies for specific use cases (e.g., web, data, security).
   - **Simplified Integration:** Starters handle complex integration details, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate technologies like databases, messaging systems, and security frameworks.
Starters handle complex integrations, ensuring seamless setup.

Example: Using Spring Boot Starter for JPA:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
Including spring-boot-starter-data-jpa simplifies Java Persistence API (JPA) integration. Spring Boot's auto-configuration manages JPA entity managers, data sources, and transaction management.

**7. Conclusion: Effortless Spring Boot Applications:**
   - **Boosted Productivity:** `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is at the heart of Spring Boot's philosophy, boosting developer productivity by simplifying setup and reducing configuration overhead.
   - **Maintenance Ease:** Applications configured with auto-configuration are easier to maintain and update, ensuring compatibility with evolving libraries and technologies.

In essence, `@EnableAutoConfiguration` encapsulates the spirit of Spring Boot‚Äîmaking Java configuration easier, more streamlined, and immensely developer-friendly. By leveraging this annotation, developers can focus on crafting robust applications while Spring Boot takes care of the intricate details under the hood.

## Managing Properties with Ease

Managing configuration data, such as database URLs, API endpoints, or feature toggles, is a crucial aspect of any application. Spring provides a flexible and powerful mechanism called **PropertySource** to handle configuration properties. With `PropertySource`, you can externalize configuration, allowing your application to adapt to different environments and scenarios without code changes.

Let‚Äôs delve into how Spring‚Äôs PropertySource simplifies the management of properties in your application.

**1. Understanding PropertySource:**
   - **What is PropertySource?:** PropertySource is an abstraction in Spring that represents a source of name-value pairs, commonly used for configuration properties.
   - **Types of PropertySources:** Spring supports various PropertySource implementations, including property files, environment variables, system properties, and more.

**2. Loading Properties from Files:**
   - **Property Files:** Spring can load properties from `.properties` files, enabling you to organize configuration data in a structured manner.
   - **YAML Files:** Alternatively, Spring supports `.yaml` or `.yml` files, providing a more human-readable format for complex configurations.

Example: Loading Properties from YAML File
```properties
# application.properties (or application.yaml for .yaml format)
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=sa
```
In this example, properties for the database connection are stored in a properties file. Spring Boot automatically loads properties from application.yml or application.properties with help of `PropertySource`.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "io.reflectoring.javaconfig")
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
public class DatabaseConfiguration {
    @Value("${spring.datasource.driver-class-name}")
    private String databaseClass;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.url}")
    private String databaseUrl;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.username}")
    private String username;

    @Value("${spring.datasource.password}")
    private String password;

    @Bean(name = "employee-management-db")
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        final DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setDriverClassName(databaseClass);
        dataSource.setUrl(databaseUrl); // H2 in-memory database URL
        dataSource.setUsername(username); // Default H2 username (sa)
        dataSource.setPassword(password); // Default H2 password (sa)

        return dataSource;
    }

}
```
To access these properties, you can use the `@Value` annotation.

**3. PropertySource and Environment Integration:**
   - **Property Resolution:** The `Environment` abstraction in Spring integrates with `PropertySource`, enabling property resolution in different contexts and profiles.
   - **Using `@Value` Annotation:** Spring components can inject property values using the `@Value` annotation, simplifying the retrieval of configuration data in beans.
   
Example: Using `@Value` Annotation for Property Resolution:
```java
@Component
public class SecurityConfig {
    
    @Value("${security.api.key}")
    private String apiKey;
    
    // Security configuration logic using the property
}
```
In this example, the `@Value` annotation is used to inject the `security.api.key` property into the `apiKey` variable. Spring resolves this property value from the active `PropertySource` and injects it into the component.

**4. Property Overrides and Hierarchical PropertySources:**
   - **Property Overrides:** Spring allows you to override properties defined in property files with system properties, environment variables, or command-line arguments.
   - **Hierarchical PropertySources:** PropertySources can be organized hierarchically, allowing for inheritance and overrides, providing a structured way to manage configuration across modules or layers.
   
Example: Hierarchical PropertySources
```properties
# application-development.properties
database.url=jdbc:mysql://dev-host:3306/devdb

# application-production.properties
database.url=jdbc:mysql://prod-host:3306/proddb
```
In this scenario, two different property files for development and production environments specify the `database.url property`. Depending on the `active profile` (development or production), Spring loads the respective properties, allowing for property overrides based on the environment.

**5. Integrating with External Systems:**
   - **Database Configuration:** PropertySource can load database connection details, enabling dynamic configuration without modifying application code.
   - **Cloud Configurations:** Spring seamlessly integrates with cloud-based configuration servers, allowing applications to fetch configuration data from centralized repositories.
   
Example: Database Configuration from External PropertySource
```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
public class DatabaseConfig {
    
    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;
    
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
        dataSource.setUrl(environment.getProperty("database.url"));
        dataSource.setUsername(environment.getProperty("database.username"));
        dataSource.setPassword(environment.getProperty("database.password"));
        return dataSource;
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Environment` object is used to fetch database connection properties from an external property source. The properties can be stored in property files, environment variables, or cloud-based configuration servers.

**6. Refreshing Properties at Runtime:**
   - **Dynamic Configuration Updates:** Spring supports dynamic property updates at runtime, allowing applications to refresh configuration without restarting, making it ideal for cloud-native and microservices architectures.
   
Example: Dynamic Configuration Update
```java
@Component
public class CacheConfig {

    @Value("${cache.ttl}")
    private int cacheTtl;

    // Cache configuration logic using the property

    // Refresh properties every minute
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000)
    public void refreshProperties() {
        // Refresh properties dynamically
        cacheTtl = Integer.parseInt(environment.getProperty("cache.ttl"));
    }
}
```
In this example, the `@Scheduled` annotation triggers a method to refresh the `cacheTtl` property every minute. By doing this, properties can be updated dynamically without requiring a restart of the application.

{{% info title="Notes on @Scheduled annotation" %}}
While `@Scheduled` itself doesn't directly interact with `PropertySource`, it's often used in scenarios where dynamic property updating is necessary. By integrating `@Scheduled` with `PropertySource`, applications can achieve dynamic configuration updates without interrupting their operation, making them more flexible and adaptable to changing configuration requirements. This combination allows applications to stay in sync with external configuration changes, ensuring they can adapt to new settings without downtime.
{{% /info %}}
\
These examples demonstrate how Spring's PropertySource mechanism simplifies property management and configuration, making applications more adaptable and secure in various deployment scenarios.

**7. Secure Property Management:**
   - **Encrypted Properties:** Spring provides mechanisms to encrypt sensitive properties, ensuring secure management of credentials and sensitive information.
   - **Secure Communication:** When fetching properties from external sources, Spring supports secure communication protocols, safeguarding sensitive data transmission.
   
Encrypting sensitive properties is crucial to secure sensitive data in applications. Spring provides support for encrypting properties using the [Jasypt library](http://www.jasypt.org/), allowing developers to store confidential information, such as passwords or API keys, in an encrypted form.

Here's how you can set up encrypted properties using Jasypt in a Spring application:

Example: Encrypted Properties with Jasypt:

1. Add Jasypt Dependency:

First, add the Jasypt dependency to your project's build file (Maven or Gradle).

**Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
    <artifactId>jasypt-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.5</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```gradle
implementation 'org.jasypt:jasypt-spring-boot-starter:3.0.5' // Use the latest version
```

See [Jasypt Spring Boot](https://github.com/ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot) for more details.

**2. Encrypt Sensitive Property:**

Encrypt the sensitive property using Jasypt's encryption tool. For example, if you want to encrypt a database password, you can use the following command:

```sh
./encryptor.sh input=yourpassword password=yourencryptionkey
```

**3. Configure Encrypted Property:**

In your `application.properties` or `application.yml`, store the encrypted property using the `ENC()` prefix:

```properties
database.password=ENC(encryptedpassword)
```

**4. Decrypt Encrypted Property:**

Spring Boot automatically detects the `ENC()` prefix and decrypts the property using the provided encryption key.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class DatabaseConfig {

    @Value("${database.password}")
    private String decryptedPassword;

    // Database configuration logic using the decrypted password
}
```

In this example, the `@Value` annotation injects the decrypted database password into the `decryptedPassword` variable. Spring Boot handles the decryption process behind the scenes using the encryption key provided during the encryption.

This approach ensures that sensitive properties are stored securely in the application's configuration files, providing an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access to confidential data.

**Notes on EnableEncryptableProperties**
The `@EnableEncryptableProperties` annotation is part of the [Jasypt Spring Boot integration](https://github.com/ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot). As noted earler, Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) is a Java library that simplifies encryption and decryption of text and provides seamless integration with Spring Boot for securing sensitive properties such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential information in application configuration files.

When you use Jasypt with Spring Boot, you can annotate your configuration classes with `@EnableEncryptableProperties`.

Here's how you can use `@EnableEncryptableProperties` in a Spring Boot application:

Example: Using @EnableEncryptableProperties with Jasypt in Spring Boot:

**a. Add Jasypt Dependency:**

Make sure you have the Jasypt Spring Boot starter dependency in your project.

**Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.ulisesbocchio</groupId>
    <artifactId>jasypt-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```gradle
implementation 'com.github.ulisesbocchio:jasypt-spring-boot-starter:3.0.5' // Use the latest version
```

**b. Annotate Configuration Class with @EnableEncryptableProperties:**

```java
@Configuration
@EnableEncryptableProperties
@PropertySource(name="EncryptedProperties", value = "classpath:encrypted.properties")
public class DatabaseConfiguration {
    // Configuration beans and other application configurations
}
```

In this example, the `@EnableEncryptableProperties` annotation enables property encryption for properties defined in .properties file.

**c. Encrypt Properties in application.properties or application.yml:**

```properties
# application.properties
myapp.password=ENC(encryptedpassword)
```

In your `application.properties` or `application.yml`, you can use the `ENC()` prefix to indicate that the property is encrypted. Jasypt will automatically decrypt the property during the application startup using the provided encryption key.

Now when you do `environment.getProperty("secret.property")` or use `@Value("${secret.property}")` what you get is the decrypted version of that property.

By using `@EnableEncryptableProperties`, you can secure sensitive properties in your Spring Boot application without having to manually decrypt them. This integration simplifies the process of encrypting and decrypting sensitive information, ensuring the security of your application's configuration data.

**8. Conclusion: Empowering Configurability in Spring Applications:**
Spring‚Äôs PropertySource provides a robust foundation for managing configuration data. By leveraging `PropertySource` and its integrations, developers can ensure that their applications are adaptable, secure, and maintainable. The ability to externalize properties and dynamically adjust configurations not only simplifies the development process but also lays the groundwork for resilient, flexible, and scalable Spring applications.

## Seamless External Configuration

In Spring applications, externalizing configuration settings is essential for flexibility. The `@PropertySource` annotation allows seamless integration of external properties. By specifying the source file, properties are injected into beans, enhancing modularity and easing configuration management. This enables developers to adapt applications to different environments effortlessly, ensuring smoother deployment and maintenance processes. With `@PropertySource`, Spring applications remain adaptable, scalable, and well-organized, embodying the principles of robust software design.

Let's delve into examples to support the seamless external configuration:

**Example: Integrating External Properties with @PropertySource**

**1. Create External Property File:**

Create a properties file, e.g., `config.properties`, containing key-value pairs of configuration properties.

```properties
# config.properties
app.name=MyApp
app.version=1.0
```

**2. Use @PropertySource in Configuration Class:**
```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:config.properties")
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {
    // Properties will be automatically injected into beans
}
```

In this example, `@PropertySource` is used to specify the location of the external property file (`config.properties`). The properties are injected into the Spring `Environment` and can be accessed through the `@Value` annotation or by using the `Environment` object directly. 

**3. Accessing Properties in a Bean:**
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {

    @Value("${app.name}")
    private String appName;

    @Value("${app.version}")
    private String appVersion;

    // Getter and setter methods
}
```

In this example, `@Value` annotation is used to inject the values of `app.name` and `app.version` from the external properties file into the `MyComponent` bean.

**4. Usage in a REST Controller:**
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Value("${app.name}")
    private String appName;

    @GetMapping("/info")
    public String getAppInfo() {
        return "Application Name: " + appName;
    }
}
```

In this REST controller, the `app.name` property is accessed and returned as part of the API response.

By leveraging `@PropertySource`, external properties are seamlessly integrated into the Spring application context. This approach offers flexibility and ease of configuration management, enabling developers to adapt their applications to different environments without modifying the source code. This modularity enhances maintainability, making it effortless to manage application configurations across various deployment scenarios.

## Summary
In the realm of Spring, mastering Java-based configuration is a gateway to flexible, maintainable, and scalable applications. Through our journey, we've unlocked the power of `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, and `@PropertySource`, seamlessly integrating external properties and enhancing modularity.
