In this article, we will learn how to use `CompletableFuture` to increase the performance of our application. We'll start with looking at the `Future` interface and its limitations and then will discuss how
we can instead use the `CompletableFuture` class to overcome these limitations. 

We will do this by building a simple
application that tries to categorize a list of bank `Transaction`s using a remote service. Let's begin our journey!

## What Is a `Future`?

**`Future` is a Java interface that was introduced in Java 5 to represent a value that will be available in the future**.
The advantages of using a `Future` are enormous because we could do some very intensive computation asynchronously
without blocking the current thread that in the meantime can do some other useful job.

We can think of it as going to the restaurant. During the time that the chef is preparing our dinner, we can do other
things, like talking to friends or drinking a glass of wine and once the chef has finished the preparation, we can
finally eat. Another advantage is that using the `Future` interface is much more developer-friendly than working
directly with threads.

## `CompletableFuture` vs. `Future`

In this section we will look at some limitations of the `Future` interface and how we can solve these by using the
`CompletableFuture` class.

### Defining a Timeout

The `Future` interface provides only the `get()` method to retrieve the result of the computation, but **if the
computation takes too long we don't have any way to complete it by returning a value that we can assign**. 

To
understand better, let's look at some code:

 ```java
class Demo {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
  Future<String> stringFuture = executor.submit(() -> neverEndingComputation());
  System.out.println("The result is: " + stringFuture.get());
  }
}
```

We have created an instance of `ExecutorService` that we will use to
submit a task that never ends - we call it `neverEndingComputation()`. 

After that we want to print the value of
the `stringFuture` variable on the console by invoking the `get()` method. This method waits if necessary for the
computation to complete, and then retrieves its result. But because we are calling `neverEndingComputation()` that never
ends, the result will never be printed on the console, and we don't have any way to complete it manually by passing a
value.

Now let's see how to overcome this limitation by using the class `CompletableFuture`. We will use the same
scenario, but in this case, we will provide our value by using the method `complete()` of the `CompletableFuture` class.

 ```java
class Demo {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  CompletableFuture<String> stringCompletableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> neverEndingComputation());
  stringCompletableFuture.complete("Completed");
  System.out.println("Is the stringCompletableFuture done ? " + stringCompletableFuture.isDone());
  }
}
```

Here we are creating a `CompletableFuture` of type `String` by calling the method `supplyAsync()` which takes a `Supplier` as an argument.

In the end, we are testing if `stringCompletableFuture` really has a value by using the
method `isDone()` which returns `true` if completed in any fashion: normally, exceptionally, or via cancellation. The
output of the `main()` method is:

```text
Is the stringCompletableFuture done ? true
```

### Combining Asynchronous Operations

Let's imagine that we need to call two remote APIs, `firstApiCall()` and `secondApiCall()`. The result of the first API
will be the input for the second API. By using the `Future` interface there is no way to combine these two operations
asynchronously: 

 ```java
class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    Future<String> firstApiCallResult = executor.submit(
            () -> firstApiCall(someValue)
    );
    
    String stringResult = firstApiCallResult.get();
    Future<String> secondApiCallResult = executor.submit(
            () -> secondApiCall(stringResult)
    );
  }
}
```

In the code example above, we call the first API by submitting a task on the `ExecutorService` that returns
a `Future`. We need to pass this value to the second API, but the only way to retrieve the value is by using the
`get()` of the `Future` method that we have discussed earlier, and by using it we block the main thread. Now we have to
wait until the first API returns the result before doing anything else.

By using the `CompletableFuture` class we don't need to block the main thread anymore, but we can asynchronously combine
more operations:

```java
class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    var finalResult = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
         () -> firstApiCall(someValue)
    )
    .thenApply(firstApiResult -> secondApiCall(firstApiResult));
  }
}
```

We are using the method `supplyAsync()` of the `CompletableFuture` class which returns a
new `CompletableFuture` that is asynchronously completed by a task running in the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`
with the value obtained by calling the given `Supplier`. After that we are taking the result of the `firstApiCall()` and
using the method `thenApply()`, we pass it to the other API invoking `secondApiCall()`.

### Reacting to Completion Without Blocking the Thread

Using the `Future` interface we don't have a way to react to the completion of an operation asynchronously. The
only way to get the value is by using the `get()` method which blocks the thread until the result is returned:

 ```java
class Demo {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    Future<String> stringFuture = executor.submit(() -> "hello future");
    String uppercase = stringFuture.get().toUpperCase();
    System.out.println("The result is: " + uppercase);
  }
}
```

The code above
creates a `Future` by returning a `String` value. Then we transform it to uppercase by firstly calling the `get()`
method and right after the `toUpperCase()` method of the `String` class.

Using `CompletableFuture` we can now create a pipeline of asynchronous operations. Let's see a simple example of how to
do it:

```java
class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "hello completable future")
        .thenApply(String::toUpperCase)
        .thenAccept(System.out::println);
  }
}
```

In the example above we can notice how simple is to create such a pipeline. First, we are calling
the `supplyAsync()` method which takes a `Supplier` and returns a new `CompletableFuture`. Then we are then transforming
the result to an uppercase string by calling `thenApply()` method. In the end, we just print the value on the console
using `thenAccept()` that takes a `Consumer` as the argument.

If we step back for a moment, we realize that working with `CompletableFuture` is very similar to Java Streams.

## Performance Gains with `CompletableFuture`

In this section we will build a simple application that takes a list of bank transactions and calls an external service
to categorize each transaction based on the description. We will simulate the call of the external service by using a
method that adds some delay before returning the category of the transaction. In the next sections we will incrementally
change the implementation of our client application to improve the performance by using CompletableFuture.

### Synchronous Implementation

Let's start implementing our categorization service that declares a method called `categorizeTransaction` :

```java
public class CategorizationService {

  public static Category categorizeTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
    delay();
    return new Category("Category_" + transaction.getId());
  }

  public static void delay() {
    try {
      Thread.sleep(1000L);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  }
}

public class Category {
  private final String category;

  public Category(String category) {
    this.category = category;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Category{" +
        "category='" + category + '\'' +
        '}';
  }
}

public class Transaction {
  private String id;
  private String description;

  public Transaction(String id, String description) {
    this.id = id;
    this.description = description;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }

  public void setId(String id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public String getDescription() {
    return description;
  }

  public void setDescription(String description) {
    this.description = description;
  }
}
```

In the code above we have a class called `Transaction` that has an `id` and a `description` field. 

We will pass an
instance of this class to the static method `categorizeTransaction(Transaction transaction)` of
our `CategorizationService` which will return an instance of the class `Category`. 

Before returning the result, the `categorizeTransaction()` method
waits for one second and then returns a `Category` object that has field of type `String`
called `description`. The `description` field will be just the concatenation of the String `"Category_"` with the `id`
field from the `Transaction` class.  

To test this implementation we will build a client application that tries to categorize three transactions, as follows :

```java
public class Demo {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    var categories = Stream.of(
            new Transaction("1", "description 1"),
            new Transaction("2", "description 2"),
            new Transaction("3", "description 3"))
        .map(CategorizationService::categorizeTransaction)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

    System.out.printf("The operation took %s ms%n", end - start);
    System.out.println("Categories are: " + categories);
  }
}
```

After running the code, it prints on the console the total time taken to categorize the three transactions, and on my
machine it is saying :

```text
The operation took 3039 ms
Categories are: [Category{category='Category_1'}, 
  Category{category='Category_2'}, 
  Category{category='Category_3'}]
```

The program takes 3 seconds to complete because we are categorizing each transaction in sequence and the time needed to categorize one
transaction is one second. In the next section, we will try to refactor our client application using a parallel stream.

### Parallel Stream Implementation

Using a parallel stream, our client application will look like this:

```java
public class Demo {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    var categories = Stream.of(
            new Transaction("1", "description 1"),
            new Transaction("2", "description 2"),
            new Transaction("3", "description 3"))
        .parallel()
        .map(CategorizationService::categorizeTransaction)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

    System.out.printf("The operation took %s ms%n", end - start);
    System.out.println("Categories are: " + categories);
  }
}
```

It's almost identical to before, apart from that here we are using the `parallel()` method to parallelize the computation. If we run this program now, it will print
the following output:

```text
The operation took 1037 ms
Categories are: [Category{category='Category_1'}, 
   Category{category='Category_2'}, 
   Category{category='Category_3'}]
```

The difference is huge! Now our application runs almost three times faster, but this is not the whole story. 

This
solution can scale until we reach the limit of the number of processors. After that the performance doesn't change
because internally the parallel stream uses a Thread pool that has a fixed number of threads that is equal to
`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`. 

In my machine, I have 8 processors, so if we run the code above with ten
transactions it should take at least 2 seconds:

```text
The operation took 2030 ms
Categories are: [Category{category='Category_1'}, 
  Category{category='Category_2'}, 
  Category{category='Category_3'}, 
  Category{category='Category_4'}, 
  Category{category='Category_5'}, 
  Category{category='Category_6'}, 
  Category{category='Category_7'}, 
  Category{category='Category_8'}, 
  Category{category='Category_9'}, 
  Category{category='Category_10'}]
```

We see that the operation took 2030 ms, as predicted. Can we do something to increase the performance of our
application even more? YES!

### Increasing Performance Using `CompletableFuture`

Now will refactor our client application to take advantage of `CompletableFuture`:

```java
public class Demo {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    var futureCategories = Stream.of(
            new Transaction("1", "description 1"),
            new Transaction("2", "description 2"),
            new Transaction("3", "description 3"),
            new Transaction("4", "description 4"),
            new Transaction("5", "description 5"),
            new Transaction("6", "description 6"),
            new Transaction("7", "description 7"),
            new Transaction("8", "description 8"),
            new Transaction("9", "description 9"),
            new Transaction("10", "description 10")
        )
        .map(transaction -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
                () -> CategorizationService.categorizeTransaction(transaction), executor)
        )
        .collect(toList());

    var categories = futureCategories.stream()
        .map(CompletableFuture::join)
        .collect(toList());
    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

    System.out.printf("The operation took %s ms%n", end - start);
    System.out.println("Categories are: " + categories);
  }
}
```

Our client application is trying to call the categorization service by using the method `supplyAsync()` that takes as
arguments a `Supplier` and an `Executor`. Here we can now pass a custom `Executor` with a pool of ten threads to make the computation finish even faster than before. 

With 10 threads, we expect that the operation should take around one second. Indeed, the output confirms the expected
result :

```text
The operation took 1040 ms
Categories are: [Category{category='Category_1'}, 
  Category{category='Category_2'}, 
  Category{category='Category_3'}, 
  Category{category='Category_4'}, 
  Category{category='Category_5'}, 
  Category{category='Category_6'}, 
  Category{category='Category_7'}, 
  Category{category='Category_8'}, 
  Category{category='Category_9'}, 
  Category{category='Category_10'}]
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to use the `Future` interface in Java and its limitations. We learned how
to overcome these limitations by using the `CompletableFuture` class. After that, we analyzed a demo application, and
step by step using the potential offered by `CompletableFuture` we refactored it for better performance.
