## Understanding Spring Configuration

In Spring based applications, **we speak of "configuration" when we want to describe how our application context is made up of different, potentially related and interacting beans**. It serves as the blueprint, guiding the behavior of our Spring-powered creations.

Configuration in Spring is all about empowering our applications with context, specifying how beans (Spring-managed objects) are created, wired, and used within the application.

Traditionally, Spring offered XML-based configuration, providing a structured way to define beans and their relationships. As the Spring ecosystem evolved, XML configurations have been replaced by more intuitive, expressive, and Java-centric approaches, simplifying the application configuration.

## Spring Configuration Essential Features

Java-based configuration in Spring enables us to use plain Java classes (POJOs) and annotations to configure our application context. With Java-based configuration, we do not need XML files. Instead, we use Java code to define our beans and their relationships.

In the upcoming sections, we will learn Spring's Java Configuration, exploring its core concepts, understanding annotations like `@Bean` and `@Configuration`, and know better ways of organizing and managing our Spring applications.

Let us first recap the essentials: beans, IoC, and DI.

### Beans: The Core of Spring
In the world of Spring, beans are the fundamental building blocks of our application. **Beans are Java objects managed by the Spring container in what is called the "application context".** Beans represent the various components of our application, from simple data objects to complex business logic. **Spring creates these beans, manages their lifecycle, and wires them together, makes our application cohesive and organized.**

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
IoC, one of the main building blocks of Spring, is a concept where the control over the object creation and lifecycle is transferred from our application to the Spring container. **Spring ensures that our beans are created, configured, and managed without our direct intervention**.

### Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is the process where beans receive their dependencies from an external source, typically the Spring container, rather than creating them internally. With DI, our beans are ready to use, making our code cleaner, more modular, and easier to test. **Spring handles the 'injection' of dependencies, ensuring our beans work seamlessly together in our application recipe.**

ðŸ‘‰ Learn more about beans, IoC, and DI in our article [Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control](http://localhost:1313/dependency-injection-and-inversion-of-control/).

## Types of Spring Configuration

Spring offers various types of configuration options, each tailored to specific needs. Let us get familiar with them.

### XML Configuration
It is the classic approach. Configure Spring beans and dependencies using XML files. Perfect for legacy systems and scenarios requiring external configuration. We're not going to dive into XML configuration in this article, however.

### Java-Based Configuration
- Use annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` to define beans.
- Configure beans with Java classes using `@Configuration` and `@Bean`.
- Combine Java-based configuration with annotation scanning for effortless bean discovery.

Manual Java-based configuration can be used in special scenarios where custom configuration and more control is needed.

In the sections to follow, we will learn about customizations offered by Java-based configuration.

Enter Spring's core concepts: `@Bean` and `@Configuration`.

{{% info title="Container Configuration vs. Application Configuration" %}}
In this article, we're talking about the configuration of the _Spring container_ (the "application context"). This configuration is about deciding which beans to include in the container and how to instantiate them.

Another aspect of configuration is to configure the way our _application_ behaves by defining application properties in YAML or properties files. While those properties can also influence the way the application context is initialized, we're not looking into application properties in this article.

To learn more about configuration using properties read our article [Configuring a Spring Boot Module with @ConfigurationProperties](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-configuration-properties/).

## Understanding @Bean
In Spring, `@Bean` transforms ordinary methods into Spring-managed beans. These beans are objects managed by the Spring IoC container, ensuring centralized control and easier dependency management. In our Employee Management System, `@Bean` helps create beans representing employees and departments.

Examples of using `@Bean`:

```java
public class Employee {
    // Employee properties and methods
}

public class Department {
    // Department properties and methods
}

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "io.reflectoring.javaconfig")
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "newEmployee", initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "destroy")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    @Cacheable(cacheNames = "employeesCache")
    public Employee newEmployee(final String firstName, final String lastName) {
        return Employee.builder().firstName(firstName).lastName(lastName).build();
    }

    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Department newDepartment(final String deptName) {
        final Department department = Department.builder().name(deptName).build();
        acme().addDepartment(department);
        return department;
    }

    @Bean(name = "founder")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Employee founderEmployee() {
        final Employee founder = newEmployee("Scott", "Tiger");
        founder.setDesignation("Founder");
        founder.setDepartment(coreDepartment());
        return founder;
    }

    @Bean(name = "core")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Department coreDepartment() {
        return newDepartment("Core");
    }

    @Bean(name = "acme")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Organization acme() {
        final Organization acmeCo = new Organization();
        acmeCo.setName("Acme Inc");
        return acmeCo;
    }
}
```
\
Here, the `newEmployee()` and `founderEmployee()` methods create an `Employee` bean, `newDepartment()` and `coreDepartment()` methods create a `Department` bean and `acme()` method creats an `Organization` bean. Spring now manages these objects, handling their lifecycle and ensuring proper dependencies.

{{% info title="Spring Bean Lifecycle: A Summary" %}}

The lifecycle of a Spring bean involves its instantiation, initialization, use, and eventual disposal. When the Spring container starts, it instantiates the beans. Then, it injects the dependencies, calls the initialization methods (if specified), and makes the bean available for use. When the container shuts down, the beans are destroyed, invoking any destruction methods (if defined).


Spring beans undergo a series of stages known as the bean lifecycle. Understanding these stages is essential for effective bean management.

Here is a concise summary of the Spring bean lifecycle methods:

1. **Instantiation:** Beans are created, either through constructor invocation or factory methods.

2. **Population of Properties:** Dependencies and properties of the bean are set.

3. **Awareness:** Beans implementing `Aware` interfaces are notified of the Spring environment and related beans. Examples include `BeanNameAware`, `BeanFactoryAware`, and `ApplicationContextAware`.

4. **Initialization:** The bean is initialized after its properties are set. This involves calling custom initialization methods specified by the developer. If a bean implements the `InitializingBean` interface, the `afterPropertiesSet()` method is invoked. Alternatively, you can define a custom initialization method and specify it in the bean configuration.

5. **In Use:** The bean is now in use, performing its intended functions within the application.

6. **Destruction:** When the application context is closed or the bean is no longer needed, the destruction phase begins. Beans can implement the `DisposableBean` interface to define custom cleanup operations in the `destroy()` method. Alternatively, you can specify a custom destruction method in the bean configuration.

Understanding these stages ensures proper initialization and cleanup of Spring beans, facilitating efficient and well-managed Spring applications.

](https://reflectoring.io/spring-bean-lifecycle/).

{{% /info %}}

### Managing Spring Bean Lifecycle with @Bean

In the context of the Employee Management System, let us learn about managing the lifecycle of a Spring bean using `@Bean` methods and related annotations.

**1. Custom Initialization and Destruction Methods:**

```java
public class Employee {

    // Bean properties and methods

    public void init() {
        // Custom initialization logic
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Custom cleanup logic
    }
}
```

In our configuration class:

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "newEmployee", initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "destroy")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    @Cacheable(cacheNames = "employeesCache")
    public Employee newEmployee(final String firstName, final String lastName) {
        return Employee.builder().firstName(firstName).lastName(lastName).build();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `newEmployee()` method creates an `Employee` bean. The `initMethod` attribute specifies a custom initialization method, and the `destroyMethod` attribute defines a custom cleanup method. When the bean is created and destroyed, these methods are invoked, allowing you to handle specific lifecycle events.

**2. Implementing InitializingBean and DisposableBean Interfaces:**

```java

public class Department implements InitializingBean, DisposableBean {

    // Bean properties and methods

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        // Initialization logic
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() throws Exception {
        // Cleanup logic
    }
}
```

In our configuration class, you can create the bean as usual:

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Department newDepartment(final String deptName) {
        final Department department = Department.builder().name(deptName).build();
        acme().addDepartment(department);
        return department;
    }
}
```

In this approach, the `Department` class implements the `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces, providing `afterPropertiesSet()` for initialization and `destroy()` for cleanup. Spring automatically detects these interfaces and calls the appropriate methods during bean lifecycle stages.

Interface `InitializingBean` is implemented by beans that need to react once all their properties have been set by a `BeanFactory`: for example, to perform custom initialization, or merely to check that all mandatory properties have been set.

Interface `DisposableBean` is implemented by beans that want to release resources on destruction. A `BeanFactory` is supposed to invoke the destroy method if it disposes a cached singleton. An application context is supposed to dispose all of its singletons on close.

These examples demonstrate how `@Bean` methods, along with custom initialization and destruction methods or interfaces like `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean`, enable precise control over the lifecycle of Spring beans within our Employee Management System.

### Specifying Bean Scope
The `@Scope` annotation allows you to define the scope of the bean. For instance, `@Scope("prototype")` indicates a new instance of the bean for every request, while the default scope is `Singleton`, creating a single bean instance per Spring IoC container.

```java
@Configuration
public class EmployeeConfig {

    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Employee employee() {
        return new Employee();
    }
}
```
{{% info title="Summary of Spring Bean Scopes" %}}
In Spring, bean scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean instance within the Spring IoC container. Choosing the right scope ensures appropriate management and usage of beans in our application. Hereâ€™s a summary of common Spring bean scopes:

1. **Singleton Scope:** Beans in Singleton scope have a single instance per Spring IoC container. It's the default scope. Singleton beans are created once and shared across the application. Use this scope for stateless beans and heavy objects to conserve resources.

2. **Prototype Scope:** Beans in Prototype scope have a new instance every time they are requested. Each request for a prototype bean creates a new object. Use this scope for stateful beans or when you need a new instance every time.

3. **Request Scope:** Beans in Request scope have a single instance per HTTP request. This scope is specific to web applications. Each HTTP request gets a new instance of the bean. Use this for stateful beans in a web context.

4. **Session Scope:** Beans in Session scope have a single instance per HTTP session. Similar to request scope but persists across multiple requests within the same session. Use this for user-specific stateful beans in a web context.

5. **Application Scope:** Beans in Application scope have a single instance per ServletContext. This means a single instance shared across all users/sessions in a web application. Use this for global, stateless beans that should be shared by all users.

6. **Custom Scope:** Besides the standard scopes, Spring allows you to create custom scopes tailored to specific requirements. Custom scopes can range from narrow scopes like thread scope to broader scopes based on business logic.

Choosing the appropriate scope depends on the specific use case and requirements of our beans. Understanding these scopes ensures that our beans are managed effectively, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring the correct behavior of our Spring application.

### Overriding Default Bean Name
By default, the bean name is the same as the method name. However, you can specify a custom name using the name attribute in the `@Bean` annotation.

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "founder")
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
    public Employee founderEmployee() {
        final Employee founder = newEmployee("Scott", "Tiger");
        founder.setDesignation("Founder");
        founder.setDepartment(coreDepartment());
        return founder;
    }
}
```

In this example, the bean is named `founder`, allowing specific identification within the application context.

The `@Qualifier` annotation is used to resolve the ambiguity that arises when multiple beans of the same type are present in the Spring container. We can use it to define the name of the bean we want to inject. In this case, we want to inject the bean with the name `founder`:

```java
public class EmployeeController {
    
    private final Employee founder;

    public EmployeeController(@Qualifier(value = "founder") Employee employee){
        this.founder = employee;
    }
}
```
There are two methods in `JavaConfigAppConfiguration` that configure an `Employee` bean. We need to use the qualifier to tell Spring which bean we are tring to wire.

Understanding `@Bean` and its related concepts is pivotal in Spring configuration. It not only creates instances but also allows fine-grained control over their lifecycle, scope, and naming conventions, empowering our Employee Management System with Spring-managed components.

## Understanding @Configuration
`@Configuration` is a annotation that marks a class as a source of bean definitions. It allows you to create beans using `@Bean` methods within the class. In our Employee Management System, `@Configuration` organizes the creation of beans, providing a centralized configuration hub.

```java
@Configuration
public class JavaConfigAppConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public Employee employee() {
        return new Employee();
    }

    @Bean
    public Department salesDepartment() {
        return new Department();
    }
}
```

With `@Configuration`, we encapsulate our bean definitions, promoting modularity and enhancing maintainability. Spring ensures that these beans are available for injection wherever needed.

In the above example, we tell Spring to add a bean of type `Employee` and a bean of type `Department` to the container. We can then inject those beans into other beans if needed.

## Building Maintainable Applications

Maintainability is a key consideration while developing Spring applications. As applications grow, it becomes essential to structure the configuration in a way that's modular and adaptable. Java-based configuration in Spring provides a robust solution, enabling the development of maintainable applications through modular configurations.

### Organise Configuration Logic
   - **Java Classes as Configuration Units:** With Java-based configuration, each Java class can encapsulate a specific set of configuration concerns. For instance, one class can handle data source configuration, another can manage security, and yet another can configure caching mechanisms.
   - **Encapsulation and Cohesion:** Each class focuses on a particular aspect of the application's configuration, promoting encapsulation and ensuring high cohesion, making the codebase more comprehensible and maintainable.

### Reuse and Compose Configurations
   - **Reusable Configurations:** Java configuration classes are highly reusable. A configuration class developed for one module can often be employed in other parts of the application or even in different projects, fostering a culture of code reuse.
   - **Composing Configurations:** By composing multiple configuration classes together, developers can create complex configurations from simpler, well-defined building blocks. This composition simplifies management and promotes a modular architecture.
   ```java
       @Configuration
       @Import({DatabaseConfiguration.class, 
                AppCacheConfiguration.class,
                SecurityConfiguration.class})
       public class InfrastructureConfiguration {
       }
       
   ```

In this example:

`@Import` Annotation: The `InfrastructureConfiguration` class uses the `@Import` annotation to import the configuration classes of individual modules. This annotation allows us to compose configurations by combining multiple configuration classes into a single configuration class.

By importing the `SecurityConfiguration`, `DatabaseConfiguration`, and `AppCacheConfiguration` classes into the `InfrastructureConfiguration`, we create a unified configuration that encompasses all the specific settings for authentication, database interactions, and caching.

You can see it in action by running the `testImportedConfig()` unit test in the example code shared on [Github](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/blob/master/spring-boot/java-config/src/test/java/io/reflectoring/spring-boot/javaconfig/InfrastructureConfiguration.java#L29).

### Testing and Unit Testing Advantages
   - **Isolated Testing:** Each configuration class can be unit-tested in isolation, ensuring that specific functionalities are correctly configured.
   - **Mocking Dependencies:** In testing, dependencies can be easily mocked, enabling focused testing of individual configuration components without relying on complex setups.

### Clear Hierarchical Structure
   - **Hierarchical Structure:** Java configuration fosters a clear hierarchical structure within the application, where configurations can be organized based on layers, modules, or features.
   - **Enhanced Readability:** The hierarchical arrangement enhances the readability of the configuration code, making it easier for us to navigate and understand the application's structure.

Java-based configuration in Spring empowers developers to create maintainable applications. By embracing modular configurations, we can build flexible, adaptable systems that respond effectively to changing requirements.

## Automatic Java Configuration

In the world of Spring Boot, `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is a powerful annotation that simplifies the process of configuring your Spring application. When you annotate your main application class with `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, you are essentially telling Spring Boot to automatically configure your application based on the libraries, dependencies, and components it finds in the classpath.

### Automatic Configuration Using @EnableAutoConfiguration
   - **Dependency Analysis:** Spring Boot analyzes your classpath to identify the libraries and components you are using.
   - **Smart Defaults:** It then automatically configures beans, components, and other settings, providing sensible default behaviors.
   
Spring Boot automatically configures essential components like the web server, database connection, and more based on your classpath and the libraries you include.

Example: Minimal Application with Auto-Configuration:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class JavaConfigApplication {

}
```
In this example, `@SpringBootApplication` includes `@EnableAutoConfiguration`. This annotation signals Spring Boot to configure the application automatically, setting up defaults based on the classpath.

### Customize and Override Auto Configurations
   - **Selective Overrides:** While Spring Boot provides auto-configuration, you can still customize and override these configurations as needed.
   - **Properties-Based Tuning:** Properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml` can fine-tune auto-configured settings.

You can customize auto-configurations using properties. For instance, you can disable a specific auto-configuration by setting a property.

Example: Disabling a Specific Auto-Configuration:
```properties
# application.properties
spring.autoconfigure.exclude=\
    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration
```
In this example, DataSourceAutoConfiguration is explicitly excluded, meaning Spring Boot won't configure a datasource bean by default.

`@OverrideAutoConfiguration` annotation can be used to override `@EnableAutoConfiguration`. It is often used in combination with `@ImportAutoConfiguration` to limit the auto-configuration classes that are loaded. It is also useful when we run tests and we want to control the auto configured beans.

See following example:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = Application.class, 
                webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT)
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@OverrideAutoConfiguration(exclude = {EnableWebMvc.class})
public class ExcludeAutoConfigIntegrationTest {

}
```

### Simplified Application Setup
   - **Reduced Boilerplate:** `@EnableAutoConfiguration` drastically reduces boilerplate code, eliminating the need for explicit configuration for many common scenarios.
   - **Rapid Prototyping:** It allows developers to quickly prototype and build applications without getting bogged down in intricate configuration details.

With auto-configuration, you can rapidly prototype applications without extensive configuration.

Example: Creating a REST Controller:
```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```
In this example, a simple REST endpoint is created without explicit configuration. Spring Boot's auto-configuration handles the setup, allowing developers to focus on the business logic.

Spring Boot's auto-configuration simplifies `@RestController` development. It handles `HTTP` message conversion, request mapping, and exception handling. Developers can focus on business logic while Spring Boot manages content negotiation and routing, streamlining RESTful API creation with sensible defaults and minimizing manual configuration.

### Perform Conditional Configuration
   - **Conditional Loading:** Auto-configuration is conditional; it's applied only if certain conditions are met.
   - **@ConditionalOnClass and @ConditionalOnProperty:** Conditions can be based on the presence of specific classes or properties, giving you fine-grained control.

Auto-configurations are conditionally applied based on specific conditions.

Example: Conditional Bean Creation:
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Conditional;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    @Conditional(MyCondition.class)
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```
In this example, MyBean is created only if the condition specified by MyCondition is met. Conditional annotations are integral to Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.

### Simplified Application Development
   - **Faster Development:** With auto-configuration, developers can focus more on business logic and features, accelerating development cycles.
   - **Convention Over Configuration:** It follows the convention over configuration principle, encouraging consistency across Spring Boot applications.

Auto-configuration simplifies the development process and promotes convention over configuration.

Example: Spring Boot Starter Usage:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
In this example, including the spring-boot-starter-web dependency automatically configures the application for web development. Spring Boot starters encapsulate auto-configurations, providing an intuitive way to include essential dependencies.

### Auto Configured Spring Boot Starter Packs
   - **Starter Packs:** Spring Boot Starter Packs are built around auto-configuration, bundling essential dependencies for specific use cases (e.g., web, data, security).
   - **Simplified Integration:** Starters handle complex integration details, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate technologies like databases, messaging systems, and security frameworks.
Starters handle complex integrations, ensuring seamless setup.

Example: Using Spring Boot Starter for JPA:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
Including spring-boot-starter-data-jpa simplifies Java Persistence API (JPA) integration. Spring Boot's auto-configuration manages JPA entity managers, data sources, and transaction management.

### Conclusion: Effortless Spring Boot Applications
   - **Boosted Productivity:** `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is at the heart of Spring Boot's philosophy, boosting developer productivity by simplifying setup and reducing configuration overhead.
   - **Maintenance Ease:** Applications configured with auto-configuration are easier to maintain and update, ensuring compatibility with evolving libraries and technologies.

In essence, `@EnableAutoConfiguration` encapsulates the spirit of Spring Bootâ€”making Java configuration easier, more streamlined, and immensely developer-friendly. By leveraging this annotation, developers can focus on crafting robust applications while Spring Boot takes care of the intricate details under the hood.
