With feature flags, we can reduce the risk of rolling out software changes to a minimum. We deploy the software with the changes, but the changes are behind a deactivated feature flag. After successful deployment, we can choose when and for which users to activate the feature. 

By reducing the deployment risk, feature flags are a main driver of DevOps metrics like lead time and deployment frequency - which are proven to have a positive impact on organizational performance (see my book notes on "[Accelerate](https://reflectoring.io/book-review-accelerate/)" for more about DevOps metrics). 

In this article, **we're going to implement feature flags with Togglz and LaunchDarkly**: Togglz is an extensible Java library, and LaunchDarkly is a cloud-based feature management platform. We'll explore how we can implement some common feature flagging use cases with each of them and discuss the pros and cons of each tool.

If you're only interested in one of the two solutions, jump ahead to the section covering it:

* [How to implement feature flags with Togglz](#togglz)
* [How to implement feature flags with LaunchDarkly](#launchdarkly)

<h2><a href="https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/feature-flags"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> Code Example</h2>

You can follow along with the code examples in this article by browsing or cloning the code of a fully functional example application [on GitHub](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/feature-flags).

## Feature Flagging Use Cases

Before we dive into the tools, let's take a look at some common feature flagging use cases. We'll try to implement each of these use cases with each of the feature flag tools so we get a feeling of what we can do with them.

There are more than the use cases discussed in this article, of course. The idea is to look at the most common use cases to compare what the different feature flagging tools can do.

### Use Case 1: Global Rollout

This is the simplest feature flag possible. We want to enable or disable a certain feature for all users. 

We deploy a new version of the application with a deactivated feature and after successful deployment, we activate (roll out) the feature for all users. We can later decide to deactivate it again - also for all users:

![A global rollout](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/global-feature-flag.png)

### Use Case 2: Percentage Rollout 

The global rollout use case is very simple and raises the question of why we would even need a feature flagging tool because we could just implement it ourselves with a simple if/else construct. So let's look at a bit more complex use case.

A percentage rollout is another very common rollout strategy in which we activate a feature for a small percentage of users first, to see if it's working as expected, and then ramp up the percentage over days or weeks until the feature is active for all users: 

![A percentage rollout](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/percentage-rollout.png)

Important in this use case is that a user stays in the same cohort over time. It's not enough to just enable a feature for 20% of the *requests*, because a user could issue multiple requests and have the feature enabled for some requests and disabled for others - which make for a rather awkward user experience. So, the evaluation of the feature flag has to take the user into account.

Also, if the percentage is increased from 20% to 30%, the new 30% cohort should include the previous 20% cohort so the feature is not suddenly deactivated for the early adopters. 

You can see that we don't really want to implement this ourselves but instead rely on a tool to do it for us.

### Use Case 3: Rollout Based on a User Attribute

The last use case we're going to look at is a targeted rollout based on a user attribute or behavior. A user attribute can be anything: the location of the user, demographic information, or attributes that are specific to our application like "the user has done a specific thing in our application".

In our example, we'll activate a certain feature after a user has clicked a certain button:

![A rollout based on user attributes](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/user-attribute-rollout.png)

Our application will set the user's `clicked` attribute to `true` after clicking the button. The feature flagging tool should take this attribute into account when evaluating the feature flag.

## Togglz

Togglz is a Java library that we can include as a dependency into our application. The concepts of the library rotate around the `FeatureManager` class:

![Togglz concepts](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/togglz.png)

Once configured, we can ask the `FeatureManager` if a certain feature is *active* for a given user. Before a feature can be active, it needs to be *enabled*. This is to ensure that we're not accidentally activating features that are not ready to be served to our users, yet.  

The `FeatureManager` has access to a `UserProvider`, which knows about the user who is currently using our application. This way, Togglz can distinguish between users and we can build features that are active for some users and inactive for others.

The `FeatureProvider` provides the `Feature`s that we want to control in our application. Different `FeatureProvider` implementations load the feature data from different locations. This feature data contains the names of the features, whether they are enabled by default, and their activation strategy. We can decide to load our features from a Java enum, a config file, or from environment variables, for example.

Each `Feature` has an `ActivationStrategy` that defines under which circumstances the feature will be active for a given user.

Finally, the `FeatureManager` has access to a `StateRepository` which stores feature state. Most importantly, this state includes whether the feature is enabled and which `ActivationStrategy` the feature is using. By default, Togglz is using an in-memory store for the feature states. 

Let's set up Togglz in our Java application to see what it can do!

### Initial Setup

We're going to set Togglz up in a Spring Boot application. We need to declare the following dependency in our `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.togglz</groupId>
    <artifactId>togglz-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

To get Togglz running, we need to declare our features somewhere. We're choosing to do this in an enum:

```java
public enum Features implements Feature {

    GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG,

    //... more features

    public boolean isActive() {
        return FeatureContext.getFeatureManager().isActive(this);
    }
}
```

For each feature that we want to use, we add a new enum constant. We can influence the features with a handful of [different annotations](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/tree/master/core/src/main/java/org/togglz/core/annotation).

What's left to do is to tell Togglz that it should use this `Features` enum. We do this by setting the `togglz.feature-enums` property in Spring Boot's `application.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
togglz:
  feature-enums: io.reflectoring.featureflags.togglz.Features
```

This configuration property points to the fully qualified class name of our `Features` enum and the Spring Boot Starter that we included in the dependencies will automatically configure Togglz with a `FeatureProvider` that uses this enum as the source of feature definitions.

We're now ready to use Togglz, so let's see how we can implement our feature flagging use cases.

### Global Boolean Rollout with Togglz

We've already seen our global boolean feature in the enum, but here it is again:

```java
public enum Features implements Feature {

    GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG;

    public boolean isActive() {
      return FeatureContext.getFeatureManager().isActive(this);
    }
}
```

We can check if the feature is active by asking the Feature Manager like in the `isActive()` convenience method in the code above. 

`Features.GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG.isActive()` would return `false`, currently, because features are disabled by default. Only if a feature is *enabled* will its `ActivationStrategy` decide whether the feature should be *active* for a given user.

We can enable the feature by setting a property in `application.yml`:

```yaml
togglz:
  features:
    GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG:
      enabled: true
```

Alternatively, we could start the application with the environment variable `TOGGLZ_FEATURES_GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG_ENABLED` set to `true`.

If we call `Features.GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG.isActive()` now, it will return `true`. 

But why is the feature *active* as soon as we *enabled* it? Aren't *enabled* and *active* different things as explained above? Yes, they are, but we haven't declared an `ActivationStrategy` for our feature. 

Without an `ActivationStrategy` all *enabled* features are automatically *active*. 

We just implemented a global boolean flag that is controlled by a configuration property or environment variable.

### Percentage Rollout with Togglz

Next, let's build a percentage rollout. Togglz calls this a "gradual rollout".

A proper percentage rollout only works when Togglz knows which user is currently using the application. So, we have to implement the `UserProvider` interface:

```java
@Component
public class TogglzUserProvider implements UserProvider {

  private final UserSession userSession;

  public TogglzUserProvider(UserSession userSession) {
    this.userSession = userSession;
  }

  @Override
  public FeatureUser getCurrentUser() {
    return new FeatureUser() {
      @Override
      public String getName() {
        return userSession.getUsername();
      }

      @Override
      public boolean isFeatureAdmin() {
        return false;
      }

      @Override
      public Object getAttribute(String attributeName) {
        return null;
      }
    };
  }
}
```

This implementation of `UserProvider` reads the current user from the session. `UserSession` is a session-scoped bean in the Spring application context (see the full code in the [example application](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/feature-flags)). 

We annotate our implementation with the `@Component` annotation so that Spring creates an object of it during startup and puts it into the application context. The Spring Boot starter dependency we added previously will automatically pick up `UserProvider` implementations from the application context and configure Togglz' `FeatureManager` with it. Togglz will now know which user is currently browsing our application.

Next, we define our feature in the `Features` enum like this:

```java
public enum Features implements Feature {

  @EnabledByDefault
  @DefaultActivationStrategy(id = GradualActivationStrategy.ID, parameters = {
          @ActivationParameter(name = GradualActivationStrategy.PARAM_PERCENTAGE, value = "50")
  })
  USER_BASED_PERCENTAGE_ROLLOUT;

  // ...
}
```

This time, we're using the `@EnabledByDefault` annotation. That means the feature is enabled and will let its activation strategy decide whether the feature is active or not for a given user. That means we don't need to add `togglz.features.GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG.enabled: true` to `application.yml` to enable it.

We're also using the `@DefaultActivationStrategy` annotation to configure this new feature to use the `GradualActivationStrategy` and configure it to activate the feature for 50% of the users.

This activation strategy creates a hashcode of the user name and the feature name, normalizes it to a value between 0 and 100, and then checks if the hashcode is below the percentage value (in our case 50). Only then will it activate the feature. See the full code of this activation strategy [here](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/togglz/core/activation/GradualActivationStrategy.java).

`Features.USER_BASED_PERCENTAGE_ROLLOUT.isActive()` will now return true for approximately 50% of the users using our application. If we have very few users with hashcodes that are close together, it might be considerably more or less than 50%, however.

### Rollout Based on a User Attribute with Togglz

Now, let's look at how to build a feature that activates only after a user has done a certain action in our application.

For this, we're going to implement the `getAttribute()` method in our `UserProvider` implementation:

```java
@Component
public class TogglzUserProvider implements UserProvider {

  // ...

  @Override
  public FeatureUser getCurrentUser() {
    return new FeatureUser() {
      @Override
      public String getName() {
        return userSession.getUsername();
      }

      @Override
      public boolean isFeatureAdmin() {
        return false;
      }

      @Override
      public Object getAttribute(String attributeName) {
        if (attributeName.equals("clicked")) {
          return userSession.hasClicked();
        }
        return null;
      }
    };
  }
}
```

Similar to `getName()`, the `getAttribute()` method returns a value from the session. We're assuming here that `userSession.hasClicked()` returns `true` only after a user has clicked a certain button in our application. In a real application, we should persist this value in the database so it will stay the same even between user sessions!

Our Togglz user objects now have the attribute `clicked` set to `true` after they have clicked the button.

Next, we implement a custom `UserClickedActivationStrategy`:

```java
public class UserClickedActivationStrategy implements ActivationStrategy {

    @Override
    public String getId() {
        return "clicked";
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Rollout based on user click";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isActive(FeatureState featureState, FeatureUser user) {
        return (Boolean) user.getAttribute("clicked");
    }

    @Override
    public Parameter[] getParameters() {
        return new Parameter[0];
    }
}
```

Note that the `isActive()` method returns the value of the user's `clicked` attribute, which we just implemented in our custom `UserProvider` implementation.

Now we can finally declare the feature in the `Features` enum:

```java
public enum Features implements Feature {

    @EnabledByDefault
    @DefaultActivationStrategy(id = "clicked")
    USER_ACTION_TARGETED_FEATURE;

    // ...
}
```

Again, we enable it by default, so that we don't have to so manually. As the activation strategy, we're using our custom `UserClickedActivationStrategy` by passing the ID of that strategy into the `DefaultActivationStrategy` annotation.

`Features.USER_ACTION_TARGETED_FEATURE.isActive()` will now return `true` only after the user has clicked a certain button in our application.

### Managing Feature Flags with the Togglz Web Console

Now that we have a few features, we want to toggle them on or off. For example, we want to do a "dark launch" for a feature. That means we don't enable it by default, deploy the feature in its disabled state, and only then decide to activate it. 

We could, of course, change the `enabled` state in the `application.yml` file and then re-deploy the application, but the point of feature flagging is that we separate deployments from enabling features, so we don't want to do this.

For managing features, Togglz offers a web console that we can deploy next to our application. With the Spring Boot integration, we can set a few properties in `application.yml` to activate it:

```yaml
togglz:
  console:
    enabled: true
    secured: false
    path: /togglz
    use-management-port: false
```

The `secured` property should be set to `true` in a production environment (or you secure it yourself). If set to `true`, only users for which `FeatureUser.isFeatureAdmin()` returns `true` will have access to the web console. This can be controlled in the `UserProvider` implementation.

Setting `use-management-port` to `false` will start the web console on the same port as our Spring Boot application.

Once the application is started with this configuration, we can access the web console on `http://localhost:8080/togglz`:

![The Togglz web console](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/togglz-console.png)

The web console allows us to enable and disable features and even to change their activation strategy on the fly. There seems to be a bug that causes the `GLOBAL_BOOLEAN_FLAG` to be listed twice, probably because the web console reads it once from the `Features` enum *and* once from the `application.yml` file.

### Deploying Togglz into Production

In a production environment, we usually want to deploy multiple nodes of our application. So, as soon as we think about a production environment for our application, we need to answer the question of **how to use Togglz across multiple application nodes**. 

This diagram outlines what a production deployment could look like:

![Example of a production deployment with Togglz](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/togglz-deployment.png)

Our users are accessing the application over a load balancer that shares the traffic across multiple application nodes. Each of these nodes is using Togglz to decide whether certain features are active or not. 

Since all application nodes should have the same state for all features, we need to connect Togglz to a feature state database that is shared across all application nodes. We can do this by implementing [Togglz' `StateRepository` interface](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/repositories.html) (or use an existing implementation like the `JdbcStateRepository`) and pointing it to a database.

To manage features, we need at least one node that serves the Togglz web console. This can be one (or all) of the application nodes, or a separate node as shown in the diagram above. This web console also has to be connected to the shared feature state database and it has to be protected from unauthorized access. 

### Other Togglz Features

In addition to what we discussed above, Togglz offers:

* a handful of different [activation strategies](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/activation-strategies.html) to control how to activate a feature,
* a handful of different [state repository implementations](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/activation-strategies.html) to store feature state in different databases,
* some pre-canned [user provider implementations](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/authentication.html) that integrate with authentication providers like Spring Security,
* [grouping features](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/feature-groups.html) in the admin console,
* [support for JUnit 4 and 5](https://www.togglz.org/documentation/testing.html) to help control feature state in tests.

In conclusion, Togglz provides a great framework to build your own feature flagging solution, but there's quite some manual work involved. Let's see how we can delegate that work using a feature management service in the cloud.

## LaunchDarkly

LaunchDarkly is a full-fledged feature management service that does most of the dirty feature flagging work for us. The name stems from the concept of a "dark launch", which is deploying a feature in a deactivated state and only activating it when the time is right.

Let's take a look at the core LaunchDarkly concepts before diving into the technicalities of controlling feature flags in Java:

![LaunchDarkly Concepts](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/launchdarkly.png)

Being a cloud service, LaunchDarkly provides web UI for us to create and configure **feature flags**. We could also create Feature Flag programmatically via the UI or various integrations with other tools, but we'll stick to the UI in this article.

For each feature flag, we can define one or more **variations**. A variation is a possible value the feature flag can have for a specific user. A boolean flag, for example, has exactly two variations: `true` and `false`. But we're not limited to boolean feature flags, but can create flags with arbitrary numbers, string values, or even JSON snippets.

To decide which variation a feature flag will show to a given user, we can define **targeting rules** for each feature flag. The simplest targeting rule is "show variation A for all users". A more complex targeting rule is "show variation A for all users with attribute X, variation B for all users with attribute Y, and variation C for all other users". We will define a different targeting rule for each of our feature flagging use cases shortly.

By default, targeting for a feature flag is deactivated. That means that the targeting rules will not be evaluated. In this state, a feature flag always serves its **default variation** (which would be the value `false` for a boolean flag, for example).

To make their decision about which variation to serve, a targeting rule needs to know about the **user** for whom it's making the decision.

In our code, we'll be asking a **LaunchDarkly client** to tell us the variation of a given feature flag for a given user. The client loads the targeting rules that we have defined in the web UI from the LaunchDarkly server and evaluates them locally. 

So, even though we are defining the targeting rules in the LaunchDarkly web UI (i.e. on a LaunchDarkly server), **the LaunchDarkly client doesn't call out to a LaunchDarkly server to poll for the variation we should serve to a given user**! Instead, the client connects to the server on startup, downloads the targeting rules, and then evaluates them on the client side. LaunchDarkly is using a [streaming architecture](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/launchdarklys-evolution-from-polling-to-streaming/) instead of a polling architecture.

This architecture is interesting from a scalability perspective because our application doesn't have to make a network call every time we need to evaluate a feature flag. It's also interesting from a resilience perspective because feature flag evaluation will still work if the LaunchDarkly server has exploded and is not answering our calls anymore.

With these concepts in mind, let's see how we can use LaunchDarkly in a Spring Boot application.

### Initial Setup

To use the LaunchDarkly Java client, we need to first include it as a dependency in our application. We add the following to our `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.launchdarkly</groupId>
    <artifactId>launchdarkly-java-server-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Before the client can talk to the LaunchDarkly server, we also need to create a LaunchDarkly account. If you want to play along with the example, you can sign up for a free trial account [here](https://app.launchdarkly.com/signup).

After signup, you get an "SDK key" that the client uses to authenticate to the server. 

We will put this key into Spring Boot's `application.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
launchdarkly:
  sdkKey: ${LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY}
```

This will set the configuration property `launchdarkly.sdkKey` to the value of the environment variable `LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY` on startup of the Spring Boot application.

We could have hard-coded the SDK key into the `application.yml` file, but it's better practice to inject secrets like this via environment variables so they don't accidentally end up in version control and who knows where from there.

The final piece of setup is to create an instance of the LaunchDarkly client and make it available to our application:

```java
@Configuration
public class LaunchDarklyConfiguration {

    private LDClient launchdarklyClient;

    @Bean
    public LDClient launchdarklyClient(@Value("${launchdarkly.sdkKey}") String sdkKey) {
        this.launchdarklyClient = new LDClient(sdkKey);
        return this.launchdarklyClient;
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() throws IOException {
        this.launchdarklyClient.close();
    }

}
```

This configuration class will create an `LDClient` instance and add it to the Spring application context. On instantiation, the client will download the current targeting rules from a LaunchDarkly server. This means we should make sure that we don't instantiate a new `LDClient` instance for each feature flag evaluation. 

To create the `LDClient` instance, we inject the SDK key.

We also implement a `@PreDestroy` method that is called when the Spring application context is shutting down (i.e. when the application is shutting down). This method tells the client to close gracefully, sending any events that it might have queued up to the server. Such events include evaluation counters for feature flags and changes in a user's attributes, for example.

With this setup, we're ready to implement our first feature flag!

### Global Boolean Rollout with LaunchDarkly

Let's start with the simplest feature flag possible: a simple boolean toggle that activates a feature for all users or none.

First, we create a feature flag with the key `global-boolean-flag` in the LaunchDarkly UI:

![Global Boolean Flag in LaunchDarkly](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/launchdarkly-global-boolean-rollout.png)

Note that we created the feature flag as a boolean flag, which means that it has exactly two variations: `true` and `false`. We also have not created a specific targeting rule, so the default rule will always serve the `false` variation.

In the screenshot, you can see that the targeting is already set to "on", which means that whatever targeting rules we define will be "live" and have an effect on our users.

As soon as the feature is saved, we can ask our `LDClient` to evaluate the feature for us:

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder(userSession.getUsername())
        .build();

boolean booleanFlagActive = launchdarklyClient
        .boolVariation("global-boolean-flag", user, false);
```

To evaluate a feature flag, the LaunchDarkly client needs to know which user the feature should be evaluated for. With our simple global boolean flag, we don't really need a user, because we want to enable the feature for everyone or nobody, but most targeting rules will evaluate differently for different users, so we need to always pass a user to the client.

In the example, we're just getting the (unique) username from our session and creating an `LDUser` object with it. Whatever we pass as a key into the `LDUser`, it needs to be a unique identifier for the user so that LaunchDarkly can recognize the user. 

A username is not the best key, by the way, because it's personally identifiable information, so a more opaque user ID is probably the better choice in most contexts.

In our code, we need to know what kind of variations the feature flag provides to call the appropriate method. In our case, we know the feature flag is a boolean flag, so we use the method `boolVariation()`. The third parameter to this method (`false`) is the value the feature should evaluate to in case the client could not make a connection to the LaunchDarkly server.

If the feature flag is configured as shown in the screenshot above, the client will know that the targeting is "on" for the feature `global-boolean-flag`, and then evaluate the default rule, which evaluates to `false`. If we change the default rule to `true`, LaunchDarkly will inform our client and the next call to `boolVariation()` will evaluate to `true`.

### Percentage Rollout with LaunchDarkly

To implement a percentage rollout with LaunchDarkly, we create a new feature named `user-based-percentage-rollout` in the LaunchDarkly UI and set the default targeting rule to a percentage rollout:

![Percentage Feature Flag in LaunchDarkly](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/launchdarkly-percentage-rollout.png)

In our code, we can now evaluate this feature flag the same as we did before:

```java
boolean percentageFlagActive = launchdarklyClient
        .boolVariation("user-based-percentage-rollout", user, false);
```

For each variation of a percentage feature flag, LaunchDarkly creates a bucket. In the case of our example, we have two buckets, one for the variation `true`, and one for the variation `false`, and each bucket has the same size (50%).

The LaunchDarkly client knows about these buckets. To determine which bucket the current user falls into, the LaunchDarkly client creates a hashcode for the user and uses it to decide on which bucket the user to put in. This allows multiple - potentially distributed - LaunchDarkly clients to evaluate to the same value for the same user, because they calculate the same hashcode.

### Rollout Based on a User Attribute with LaunchDarkly

We can implement more complex targeting strategies in the same fashion. We configure the targeting rules in the LaunchDarkly UI, and then ask the LaunchDarkly client for the variation for the given user.

Let's assume that we want to enable a certain feature for users only after they have clicked a certain button in our application. For this case, we can create a targeting rule that serves `true` only for users with the `clicked` attribute set to `true`:

![Feature Flag based on a user attribute in LaunchDarkly](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/launchdarkly-attribute-rollout.png)

But how does LaunchDarkly know about the `clicked` attribute of a user? We need to pass it into the client:

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder(userSession.getUsername())
        .custom("clicked", userSession.hasClicked())
        .build();

boolean clickedFlagActive = launchdarklyClient
        .boolVariation("user-clicked-flag", user, false);
```

When we create the `LDUser` object, we now set the `clicked` custom attribute to a value that - in our example - we get from the user session. With the `clicked` attribute, the LaunchDarkly client can now properly evaluate the feature flag.

After a feature has been evaluated for a user with a given attribute, LaunchDarkly will show the user's attributes in its user dashboard:

![User attributes in the LaunchDarkly user dashboard](/assets/img/posts/feature-flag-tools/launchdarkly-alice.png)

Note that LaunchDarkly only shows these user attributes as a convenience. **The user attributes are evaluated by the LaunchDarkly client, not the LaunchDarkly server**! So, if our application doesn't set the `clicked` attribute of the `LDUser` object, our example feature flag will evaluate to `false`, even if we have set the `clicked` attribute to `true` in a previous call!

### Additional Features

The targeting rules in our examples above are still rather simple examples, given the flexibilty the LaunchDarkly UI offers to create targeting rules. 

As mentioned, LaunchDarkly not only supports boolean feature flags, but any number of variations of different types like strings, numbers, or JSON. This opens the door to pretty much every feature flagging use case one can think of.

In addition to flexible targeting rules, LaunchDarkly offers a lot of features that a geared towards teams and even Enterprises:

* analytics across our feature flags,
* designing [feature workflows](https://launchdarkly.com/features/feature-workflows/) with scheduled feature releases and approval steps,
* auditing on feature flag changes, so we can reconstruct the variations of a feature flag at a given point in time,
* debugging feature flags in the LaunchDarkly UI to verify that features are evaluated to the expected variation,
* slicing our user base into segments to target each segment differently,
* running [experiments](https://launchdarkly.com/features/experimentation/) by pairing a feature flag with a certain metric from our application to gauge how the feature impacts the metric,
* and [a lot more](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/).

## Conclusion - What's the Best Feature Flagging Solution for Me?

The two solutions discussed in this article are very different. As is often the case when deciding on a tool that solves a specific problem, you can't really say that one solution is "better" than another without taking your context into account.

Togglz is a Java library that we can easily extend by implementing some interfaces, but it doesn't scale well with a lot of features (because they will be hard to find in the web console) and we have some custom work to self-host the web console and to integrate it with a database, for example.

LaunchDarkly, on the other hand, is a full-blown feature management platform that supports many programming languages, allows very flexible targeting rules and scales to an almost limitless number of feature flags without impacting performance too much. But it follows a subscription model and we're sharing our feature data with them.

For small teams who are working on a few - exclusively Java - codebases with tens of features, Togglz is a great way to get started with feature flags.

For bigger teams or enterprises with multiple codebases - potentially across multiple programming languages - and hundreds or even thousands of feature flags, there is no way around a feature management platform like LaunchDarkly.

Here's an (incomplete) list of aspects to think about when deciding on a feature flagging solution for your context:

| Aspect                      | Togglz                          | LaunchDarkly                             |
| ----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Targeting strategies        | By implementing the `ActivationStrategy` interface | By configuring a targeting rule in the UI, via API, or via integration |
| Changing the targeting      | Might need redeployment of a new `ActivationStrategy` | Any time by changing a rule in the UI | 
| Targeting by application environment (staging, prod, ...) | No concept of application environments | Feature flags can be configured to evaluate differently for different  environments
| Programming Languages       | Java                            | [Many](https://launchdarkly.com/features/sdk/) |
| Feature variations          | Only boolean                    | Booleans, strings, numbers, and JSON              |
| Feature management          | Via self-hosted web console | Via web console in the cloud |
| Feature state               | By implementing a `StateRepository` interface | Managed by LaunchDarkly servers or a self-hosted [Relay Proxy](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/relay-proxy) |
| Feature analytics           | Needs to be custom-built        | Out-of-the-box
| Working in a team           | Simple feature management in the web console | Audit logs, user dashboard, feature ownership, ... |
| Enterprise                  | Simple feature management in the web console | Workflows, custom roles, SSO/SCIM/SAML login, code references, ... |
| Cost                        | Cost of customizing             | Per-seat fee |
| Integrations | Spring Boot, Spring Security, EJB | No out-of-the-box integrations with Java frameworks |
