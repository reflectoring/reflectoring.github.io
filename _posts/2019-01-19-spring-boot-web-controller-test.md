In this second part of the series on testing with Spring Boot, we're going to look
at web controllers. First, we're going to explore what a web controller actually does
so that we can build tests that cover all of its responsibilities.

Then, we're going to find out how to cover each of those responsibilities in a test.
Only with those responsibilities covered can we be sure that our controllers behave as
expected in a production environment.

## The "Testing with Spring Boot" Series

This tutorial is part of a series:

1. [Unit Testing with Spring Boot](/unit-testing-spring-boot/)
2. [Testing Spring MVC Web Controllers with Spring Boot and `@WebMvcTest`](/spring-boot-web-controller-test/)
3. [Testing JPA Queries with Spring Boot and `@DataJpaTest`](/spring-boot-data-jpa-test/)
4. [Integration Tests with `@SpringBootTest`](/spring-boot-test/)

**If you like learning from videos, make sure to check out Philip's** [**Testing Spring Boot Applications Masterclass**](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/13745/194393) (if you buy through this link, I get a cut). 

## Dependencies

We're going to use JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5) as the testing framework, Mockito for
mocking, AssertJ for creating assertions and Lombok to reduce boilerplate code:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
  compileOnly('org.projectlombok:lombok')
  testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')
  testCompile 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.2.0'
  testCompile('org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:2.23.0')
}
```

AssertJ and Mockito automatically come with the dependency to `spring-boot-starter-test`.

## Responsibilities of a Web Controller

Let's start by looking at a typical REST controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequiredArgsConstructor
class RegisterRestController {
  private final RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

  @PostMapping("/forums/{forumId}/register")
  UserResource register(
          @PathVariable("forumId") Long forumId,
          @Valid @RequestBody UserResource userResource,
          @RequestParam("sendWelcomeMail") boolean sendWelcomeMail) {

    User user = new User(
            userResource.getName(),
            userResource.getEmail());
    Long userId = registerUseCase.registerUser(user, sendWelcomeMail);

    return new UserResource(
            userId,
            user.getName(),
            user.getEmail());
  }

}
```

The controller method is annotated with `@PostMapping` to define the URL, HTTP method and content type
it should listen to.

It takes input via parameters annotated with `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`,
and `@RequestParam` which are automatically filled from the incoming HTTP request. 

Parameters my be annotated with `@Valid` to indicate that Spring should perform
[bean validation](/bean-validation-with-spring-boot/) on them.

The controller then works with those parameters, calling the business logic before returning a plain
Java object, which is automatically mapped into JSON and written into the HTTP response body 
by default.

There's a lot of Spring magic going on here. In summary, for each request, a controller 
usually does the following steps:

| # | Responsibility              | Description |
|---|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1.| **Listen to HTTP Requests** | The controller should respond to certain URLs, HTTP methods and content types.
| 2.| **Deserialize Input**       | The controller should parse the incoming HTTP request and create Java objects from variables in the URL, HTTP request parameters and the request body so that we can work with them in the code.
| 3.| **Validate Input**          | The controller is the first line of defense against bad input, so it's a place where we can validate the input.
| 4.| **Call the Business Logic** | Having parsed the input, the controller must transform the input into the model expected by the business logic and pass it on to the business logic.
| 5.| **Serialize the Output**    | The controller takes the output of the business logic and serializes it into an HTTP response.
| 6.| **Translate Exceptions**    | If an exception occurs somewhere on the way, the controller should translate it into a meaningful error message and HTTP status for the user.
  
A controller apparently has a lot to do!  
**We should take care not to 
add even more responsibilities like performing business logic**. Otherwise, our
controller tests will become fat and unmaintainable. 

How are we going to write meaningful tests that cover all of those responsibilities?

## Unit or Integration Test?

Do we write unit tests? Or integration tests? What's the 
difference, anyways? Let's discuss both approaches and decide for one.

**In a unit test, we would test the controller in isolation**. That means we would
instantiate a controller object, [mocking away the business logic](/unit-testing-spring-boot/#using-mockito-to-mock-dependencies),
and then call the controller's methods and verify the response.

Would that work in our case? Let's check which of the 6 responsibilities
we have identified above we can cover in an isolated unit test:

| # | Responsibility              | Covered in a Unit Test? |
|---|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1.| **Listen to HTTP Requests** | <i class="fa fa-times" style="color:red" title="no"></i> No, because the unit test would not evaluate the `@PostMapping` annotation and similar annotations specifying the properties of a HTTP request.
| 2.| **Deserialize Input**       | <i class="fa fa-times" style="color:red" title="no"></i> No, because annotations like `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable` would not be evaluated. Instead we would provide the input as Java objects, effectively skipping deserialization from an HTTP request.  
| 3.| **Validate Input**          | <i class="fa fa-times" style="color:red" title="no"></i> Not when depending on bean validation, because the `@Valid` annotation would not be evaluated.
| 4.| **Call the Business Logic** | <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green" title="yes"></i> Yes, because we can verify if the mocked business logic has been called with the expected arguments.
| 5.| **Serialize the Output**    | <i class="fa fa-times" style="color:red" title="no"></i> No, because we can only verify the Java version of the output, and not the HTTP response that would be generated.   
| 6.| **Translate Exceptions**    | <i class="fa fa-times" style="color:red" title="no"></i> No. We could check if a certain exception was raised, but not that it was translated to a certain JSON response or HTTP status code.

In summary, **a simple unit test will not cover the HTTP layer**. 
So, we need to introduce Spring to our test to do the HTTP magic for us. 
Thus, we're building an integration test that tests the integration between
our controller code and the components Spring provides for HTTP support.

An integration test with Spring fires
up a Spring application context that contains all the beans we need. This includes
framework beans that are responsible for listening to certain URLs, serializing and deserializing to and from
JSON and translating exceptions to HTTP. These beans will evaluate the annotations
that would be ignored by a simple unit test.

So, how do we do it?

## Verifying Controller Responsibilities with `@WebMvcTest`

Spring Boot provides the `@WebMvcTest` annotation to fire up an application context
that contains only the beans needed for testing a web controller:

```java
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@WebMvcTest(controllers = RegisterRestController.class)
class RegisterRestControllerTest {
  @Autowired
  private MockMvc mockMvc;

  @Autowired
  private ObjectMapper objectMapper;

  @MockBean
  private RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

  @Test
  void whenValidInput_thenReturns200() throws Exception {
    mockMvc.perform(...);
  }

}
```

<div class="notice success">
  <h4><code>@ExtendWith</code></h4>
  <p>
  The code examples in this tutorial use the <code>@ExtendWith</code> annotation to tell
  JUnit 5 to enable Spring support. <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.1-Release-Notes#junit-5">As of Spring Boot 2.1</a>, we no longer need to
  load the <code>SpringExtension</code> because it's included as a meta annotation in the 
  Spring Boot test annotations like <code>@DataJpaTest</code>, <code>@WebMvcTest</code>, and 
  <code>@SpringBootTest</code>.
  </p>
</div> 

We can now `@Autowire` all the beans we need from the application context. Spring Boot automatically 
provides beans like an `@ObjectMapper` to map to and from JSON and a
`MockMvc` instance to simulate HTTP requests. 

We use `@MockBean` to mock away the business logic, since we don't want
to test integration between controller and business logic, but 
between controller and the HTTP layer. `@MockBean` automatically
replaces the bean of the same type in the application context with a 
Mockito mock. 

You can read more about the `@MockBean` annotation in [my article](/spring-boot-mock/) about mocking.

<div class="notice success">
  <h4>Use <code>@WebMvcTest</code> with or without the <code>controllers</code> parameter?</h4>
  <p>
  By setting the <code>controllers</code> parameter to <code>RegisterRestController.class</code>
  in the example above, we're telling Spring Boot to restrict the application context created
  for this test to the given controller bean and some framework beans needed for Spring Web MVC.
  All other beans we might need have to be included separately or mocked away with <code>@MockBean</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If we leave away the <code>controllers</code> parameter, Spring Boot will include <em>all</em>
  controllers in the application context. Thus, we need to include or mock away <em>all</em>
  beans any controller depends on. This makes for a much more complex test setup with more dependencies,
  but saves runtime since all controller tests will re-use the same application context.
  </p>
  <p>
  I tend to restrict the controller tests to the narrowest application context possible in order to
  make the tests independent of beans that I don't even need in my test, even though
  Spring Boot has to create a new application context for each single test.
  </p>
</div>

Let's go through each of the responsibilities and see how we can 
use `MockMvc` to verify each of them in order build the best integration 
test we can.

### 1. Verifying HTTP Request Matching

Verifying that a controller listens to a certain HTTP request is pretty straightforward.
We simply call the `perform()` method of `MockMvc` and provide the URL we want
to test:

```java
mockMvc.perform(post("/forums/42/register")
    .contentType("application/json"))
    .andExpect(status().isOk());
```

Aside from verifying that the controller responds to a certain URL, this test also verifies the correct HTTP method (`POST` in our case)
and the correct request content type. The controller we have seen above would reject any requests with a different 
HTTP method or content type.

Note that this test would still fail, yet, since our controller expects some input parameters.

More options to match HTTP requests can be found in the Javadoc of 
[MockHttpServletRequestBuilder](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/request/MockHttpServletRequestBuilder.html).

### 2. Verifying Input Serialization

To verify that the input is successfully serialized into Java objects, we have to provide it in the 
test request. Input can be either the JSON content of the request body (`@RequestBody`), a
variable within the URL path (`@PathVariable`), or an HTTP request parameter (`@RequestParam`):

```java
@Test
void whenValidInput_thenReturns200() throws Exception {
  UserResource user = new UserResource("Zaphod", "zaphod@galaxy.net");
  
   mockMvc.perform(post("/forums/{forumId}/register", 42L)
        .contentType("application/json")
        .param("sendWelcomeMail", "true")
        .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(user)))
        .andExpect(status().isOk());
}
```  

We now provide the path variable `forumId`, the request parameter `sendWelcomeMail` and the request body that are 
expected by the controller.
The request body is generated using the `ObjectMapper` provided by Spring Boot,
serializing a `UserResource` object to a JSON string.

If the test is green, we now know that the controller's `register()` method
has received those parameters as Java objects and that they have been
successfully parsed from the HTTP request. 

### 3. Verifying Input Validation

Let's say the `UserResource` uses the `@NotNull` annotation to deny `null` values:

```java
@Value
public class UserResource {

  @NotNull
  private final String name;

  @NotNull
  private final String email;
  
}
```

Bean validation is triggered automatically when we [add the `@Valid` annotation to a method parameter](/bean-validation-with-spring-boot/#validating-input-to-a-spring-mvc-controller)
like we did with the `userResource` parameter in our controller. So, for the happy path (i.e. when the validation
succeeds), the test we created in the previous section is enough. 

If we want to test if the validation fails as expected, we need to add a test case in which we send 
an invalid `UserResource` JSON object to the controller. We then expect the controller to return HTTP status
400 (Bad Request):

```java
@Test
void whenNullValue_thenReturns400() throws Exception {
  UserResource user = new UserResource(null, "zaphod@galaxy.net");
  
  mockMvc.perform(post("/forums/{forumId}/register", 42L)
      ...
      .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(user)))
      .andExpect(status().isBadRequest());
}
``` 

Depending on how important the validation is for the application, we might add a test case like this
for each invalid value that is possible. This can quickly add up to a lot of test cases, though, so you should talk to your
team about how you want to handle validation tests in your project.

### 4. Verifying Business Logic Calls

Next, we want to verify that the business logic is called as expected. 
In our case, the business logic is provided by the `RegisterUseCase` interface and expects a `User` object
and a `boolean` as input:

```java
interface RegisterUseCase {
  Long registerUser(User user, boolean sendWelcomeMail);
}
```

We expect the controller to transform the incoming `UserResource` object into a `User` and to pass this
object into the `registerUser()` method. 

To verify this, we can ask
the `RegisterUseCase` mock, which has been injected into the application context with the `@MockBean` annotation:

```java
@Test
void whenValidInput_thenMapsToBusinessModel() throws Exception {
  UserResource user = new UserResource("Zaphod", "zaphod@galaxy.net");
  mockMvc.perform(...);

  ArgumentCaptor<User> userCaptor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(User.class);
  verify(registerUseCase, times(1)).registerUser(userCaptor.capture(), eq(true));
  assertThat(userCaptor.getValue().getName()).isEqualTo("Zaphod");
  assertThat(userCaptor.getValue().getEmail()).isEqualTo("zaphod@galaxy.net");
}
``` 

After the call to the controller has been performed, we use an `ArgumentCaptor` to
capture the `User` object that was passed to the `RegisterUseCase.registerUser()` and assert
that it contains the expected values.

The `verify` call checks that `registerUser()` has been called exactly once.

Note that if we do a lot of assertions on `User` objects, we can create [our own custom Mockito assertion methods](/unit-testing-spring-boot/#creating-readable-assertions-with-assertj)
for better readability.

### 5. Verifying Output Serialization

After the business logic has been called, we expect the controller to map the result into a JSON string 
and include it in the HTTP response. In our case, we expect the HTTP response body to contain a valid
`UserResource` object in JSON form:

```java
@Test
void whenValidInput_thenReturnsUserResource() throws Exception {
  MvcResult mvcResult = mockMvc.perform(...)
      ...
      .andReturn();

  UserResource expectedResponseBody = ...;
  String actualResponseBody = mvcResult.getResponse().getContentAsString();
  
  assertThat(actualResponseBody).isEqualToIgnoringWhitespace(
              objectMapper.writeValueAsString(expectedResponseBody));
}
```

To do assertions on the response body, we need to store the result of the HTTP interaction in a variable of type
`MvcResult` using the `andReturn()` method. 

We can then read the JSON string from the response body and compare it to
the expected string using `isEqualToIgnoringWhitespace()`. 
We can build the expected JSON string from a Java object using the `ObjectMapper` provided 
by Spring Boot. 

Note that we can make this much more readable by using a custom `ResultMatcher`, [as described later](#matching-json-output).

### 6. Verifying Exception Handling

Usually, if an exception occurs, the controller should return a certain HTTP status. 400, if something
is wrong with the request, 500, if an exception bubbles up, and so on.

Spring takes care of most of these cases by default. However, if we have a custom exception handling,
we want to test it. Let's say we want to return a structured JSON error response with a field name
and error message for each field that was invalid in the request. We'd create a `@ControllerAdvice`
like this:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
class ControllerExceptionHandler {
  @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
  @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
  @ResponseBody
  ErrorResult handleMethodArgumentNotValidException(MethodArgumentNotValidException e) {
    ErrorResult errorResult = new ErrorResult();
    for (FieldError fieldError : e.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors()) {
      errorResult.getFieldErrors()
              .add(new FieldValidationError(fieldError.getField(), 
                  fieldError.getDefaultMessage()));
    }
    return errorResult;
  }

  @Getter
  @NoArgsConstructor
  static class ErrorResult {
    private final List<FieldValidationError> fieldErrors = new ArrayList<>();
    ErrorResult(String field, String message){
      this.fieldErrors.add(new FieldValidationError(field, message));
    }
  }

  @Getter
  @AllArgsConstructor
  static class FieldValidationError {
    private String field;
    private String message;
  }
  
}
```    

If bean validation fails, Spring throws an `MethodArgumentNotValidException`. We handle this
exception by mapping Spring's `FieldError` objects into our own `ErrorResult` data structure.
The exception handler causes all controllers to return HTTP status 400 in this case and
puts the `ErrorResult` object into the response body as a JSON string. 

To verify that this actually happens, we expand on our earlier test for failing validations:

<a name="validation_code_example"></a>
```java
@Test
void whenNullValue_thenReturns400AndErrorResult() throws Exception {
  UserResource user = new UserResource(null, "zaphod@galaxy.net");

  MvcResult mvcResult = mockMvc.perform(...)
          .contentType("application/json")
          .param("sendWelcomeMail", "true")
          .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(user)))
          .andExpect(status().isBadRequest())
          .andReturn();

  ErrorResult expectedErrorResponse = new ErrorResult("name", "must not be null");
  String actualResponseBody = 
      mvcResult.getResponse().getContentAsString();
  String expectedResponseBody = 
      objectMapper.writeValueAsString(expectedErrorResponse);
  assertThat(actualResponseBody)
      .isEqualToIgnoringWhitespace(expectedResponseBody);
}
```
Again, we read the JSON string from the response body and compare it against an expected JSON string.
Additionally, we check that the response status is 400.

This, too, can be implemented in a much more readable manner, [as we'll learn below](#matching-expected-validation-errors).

## Creating Custom ResultMatchers

Certain assertions are rather hard to write and, more importantly, hard to read.
Especially when we want to compare the JSON string from the HTTP response to an expected value
it takes a lot of code, as we have seen in the last two examples.

Luckily, we can create custom `ResultMatcher`s that we can use within the fluent API
of `MockMvc`. Let's see how we can do this for our use cases.

### Matching JSON Output

Wouldn't it be nice to use the following code to verify if the HTTP response body contains
a JSON representation of a certain Java object?

```java
@Test
void whenValidInput_thenReturnsUserResource_withFluentApi() throws Exception {
  UserResource user = ...;
  UserResource expected = ...;

  mockMvc.perform(...)
      ...
      .andExpect(responseBody().containsObjectAsJson(expected, UserResource.class));
}
```

No need to manually compare JSON strings anymore. And it's much better readable. In fact,
the code is so self-explanatory that I'm going to stop explaining here.

To be able to use the above code, we create a custom `ResultMatcher`:

```java
public class ResponseBodyMatchers {
  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

  public <T> ResultMatcher containsObjectAsJson(
      Object expectedObject, 
      Class<T> targetClass) {
    return mvcResult -> {
      String json = mvcResult.getResponse().getContentAsString();
      T actualObject = objectMapper.readValue(json, targetClass);
      assertThat(actualObject).isEqualToComparingFieldByField(expectedObject);
    };
  }
  
  static ResponseBodyMatchers responseBody(){
    return new ResponseBodyMatchers();
  }
  
}
``` 

The static method `responseBody()` serves as the entrypoint for our fluent API. It returns the
actual `ResultMatcher` that parses the JSON from the HTTP response body and compares
it field by field with the expected object that is passed in. 

### Matching Expected Validation Errors

We can even go a step further to simplify our exception handling test. It took
us [4 lines of code](#validation_code_example) to verify that the JSON response contained a certain error message.
We can to it in one line instead:

```java
@Test
void whenNullValue_thenReturns400AndErrorResult_withFluentApi() throws Exception {
  UserResource user = new UserResource(null, "zaphod@galaxy.net");

  mockMvc.perform(...)
      ...
      .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(user)))
      .andExpect(status().isBadRequest())
      .andExpect(responseBody().containsError("name", "must not be null"));
}
```

Again, the code is self-explanatory. 

To enable this fluent API, we must add the method
`containsErrorMessageForField()` to our `ResponseBodyMatchers` class from above:

```java
public class ResponseBodyMatchers {
  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

  public ResultMatcher containsError(
        String expectedFieldName, 
        String expectedMessage) {
    return mvcResult -> {
      String json = mvcResult.getResponse().getContentAsString();
      ErrorResult errorResult = objectMapper.readValue(json, ErrorResult.class);
      List<FieldValidationError> fieldErrors = errorResult.getFieldErrors().stream()
              .filter(fieldError -> fieldError.getField().equals(expectedFieldName))
              .filter(fieldError -> fieldError.getMessage().equals(expectedMessage))
              .collect(Collectors.toList());

      assertThat(fieldErrors)
              .hasSize(1)
              .withFailMessage("expecting exactly 1 error message"
                         + "with field name '%s' and message '%s'",
                      expectedFieldName,
                      expectedMessage);
    };
  }

  static ResponseBodyMatchers responseBody() {
    return new ResponseBodyMatchers();
  }
}
```

All the ugly code is hidden within this helper class and we can happily write clean assertions
in our integration tests.

## Conclusion

Web controllers have a lot of responsibilities. If we want to cover a web controller with meaningful
tests, it's not enough to just check if it returns the correct HTTP status. 

With `@WebMvcTest`, Spring Boot provides everything we need to build web controller tests, but for 
the tests to be meaningful, we need to remember to cover all of the responsibilities. Otherwise,
we may be in for ugly surprises at runtime.

The example code from this article is available [on github](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/spring-boot-testing).
