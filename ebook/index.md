<blockquote style="clear: none"><strong>A good software architecture should keep the cost of development low over the complete lifetime of an application.</strong></blockquote>

Ever wondered about how to implement a "Clean Architecture" or a "Hexagonal Architecture"?
There's a lot of buzz around these keywords, but you can find very little hands-on material
on this topic.

**This book provides an opinionated approach to the Hexagonal architecture
style from the concepts behind it down to actual code.**
