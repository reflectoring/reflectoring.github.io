Hi, I'm Tom, and I run the reflectoring blog. 

I'm a software developer, consultant, architect, coach ... whatever the role, I'm
focused on getting software ready for production.

> **The goal of this blog is to persist the things I learned so that you (and future me)
> don't have to learn them the hard way (again)**.

With this blog, I produce:

 * deep-dive tutorials about [Spring Boot](/categories/spring-boot)
 * hands-on tutorials about [Java](/categories/java)
 * opinion on practices of the [Software Craft](/categories/software-craft)
 * [book reviews](/categories/book-reviews) of the (non-fiction) books I've read.

If you're interested in working with me or have any feedback about my writing, don't hesitate to contact me.
