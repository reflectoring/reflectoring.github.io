Amazon Web Services provide many possibilities to secure data in the cloud. In this article, we will have a closer look at how to encrypt different types of data at rest on AWS.

## Why Encryption?

When we work with any AWS service, we create data that is stored in some storage of AWS. Why should this data be encrypted?

Cloud providers like AWS have several customers all around world. When we have our data in the cloud, we want to protect this data from the cloud provider and other customers of this cloud provider. We want to be sure that only we can read the data that we store in the cloud. 

We also want to prevent our data from being read, in case it gets into the hands of unauthorized people or applications through intentional or accidental means. 

Due to these reasons, many customers have a concern about unauthorized access to the data stored in plain text in the cloud. **Encryption solves this problem of securing data stored in the cloud.**

>The primary reason for encrypting data is **confidentiality**.

## Encryption Basics for Storage
We need keys to encrypt data. Keys that we need for encryption are of two types:

* Symmetric keys
* Asymmetric keys

**Symmetric keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data with the same key**. It means somebody who encrypts data has to share the encryption key with someone who needs to decrypt the data.

**An asymmetric key is actually a key pair that consists of a private key and public key**. The data, that is encrypted with the public key can be decrypted with the private key only. It means, that if a sender wants to send encrypted data to a receiver, they use the public key of the receiver for encryption of the data. The receiver then uses their private key for the decryption of the data.

The receiver also securely stores the private key in storage like a protected file system or specialized software or hardware.

Encryption and decryption with a symmetric key is much faster than with an asymmetric key.

It is however less secure since the entities which want to correspond via symmetric encryption must share the encryption key.

If the channel used to share the key is compromised, the entire system for sharing secure messages gets broken. This can be exploited by anyone with the key since they can encrypt or decrypt all communications between the entities.

## Overview of Data Encryption on AWS

As mentioned above we can use encryption to secure data at rest and in transit.

Let us have a deeper look at the encryption of data at rest.

Since we want to encrypt and decrypt data at one and not at different places, we can use a symmetric key for that. 
If we encrypt data on an AWS storage we have two approaches:

* Client-side encryption
* Server-side encryption

**In Client-side encryption, the data is encrypted outside of the AWS Cloud and then sent to storage**. It is stored on an AWS storage in encrypted form, but AWS has nothing to do with the encryption.

When the client wants to read data, it has to decrypt the data on the client-side after extracting the encrypted data from AWS. We use this approach if we want to use cloud storage, but we don't trust the security service of the cloud provider and want to secure the data on our own.

**In Server-side encryption, AWS takes care of the encryption of the data in its storage**. The encryption process is transparent for the client, who writes or reads this data.

AWS provides several possibilities for server-side encryption on storage.

In general, we need to perform three steps to protect our data:

1. Get a key for encryption
2. Encrypt data
3. Store the key securely

AWS provides two services for managing encryption keys:

* [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/?nc1=h_ls)
* [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/?nc1=h_ls)


## Amazon Key Management Service (KMS)

Let's look at the AWS KMS service which we can use to manage our encryption keys.

Most storage services in AWS support encryption and have good integration with AWS KMS for managing the encryption keys to encrypt their data.

### Advantages of KMS

* KMS provides a centralized system for managing our encryption keys.

* KMS uses hardware security modules (HSM) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your keys encryption keys. No one, including AWS employees, can retrieve our plaintext keys from the service.

* Each KMS request can be audited by enabling [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail). The audit logs contain details of the user, time, date, API action and, the key used.

* We also get the advantages of scalability, durability, and high availability compared to an on-premise Key management solution. 

* KMS functions are available as APIs and bundled into SDKs which make it possible to integrate with any custom application for key management.

### Working of KMS

It is important to understand CMK and data keys to understand the working of KMS.

#### Customer Master Key (CMK)
KMS maintains a logical representation of the key it manages in the form of a customer master key (CMK). The CMK also contains the key ID, creation date, description, and state of the key. CMKs in any one of the states: Enabled, Disabled, PendingImport, PendingDeletion, or Unavailable.

AWS KMS has three types of CMKs: 
1. **Customer-managed CMK**: The customer creates and manages these CMKs and has full control over them.
2. **AWS managed CMK**: These CMKs are created, managed, and used on our behalf by an AWS service that is integrated with AWS KMS.
3. **AWS owned CMK**: These are owned and managed by the AWS services for use in multiple AWS accounts. We cannot view and use these CMKs and are not charged any fee for their usage.

Some AWS services support only an AWS-managed CMK. Others use an AWS-owned CMK or offer a choice of CMKs.

#### Data Key
Data keys are the keys that we use to encrypt data and other data encryption keys.

We use AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) to generate, encrypt, and decrypt data keys.

The data key is used outside of KMS, such as when using OpenSSL for client-side encryption using a unique symmetric data key.

#### Data Key Pair
a data key pair is an asymmetric data key consisting of a pair of public key and private key. They are used for client-side encryption and decryption, or signing and verification of messages outside of AWS KMS. 

The private key in each data key pair is protected under symmetric CMK in AWS KMS. Both RSA and Elliptic curve key pair algorithms are supported.

For signing, the private key of the data key pair is used to generate a cryptographic signature for a message. Anyone with the corresponding public key can use it to verify the integrity of the message.

#### Source of Key Material

If we create a CMK we have two possibilities to get the key:
1. **KMS generates the key material**: We define what kind of key we want to have and KMS creates the key material for us. We get the reference to the key and use it for encryption operations.
2. **Bring your own key (BYOK)**: We create a CMK without key material and then import the key material from outside into the CMK.

#### Key Rotation

Reusing the key for many cryptographic operations is not a good idea. Should the key be stolen, all encrypted data can be decrypted. That's why it is important to rotate CMK. We can do it manually by creating new CMKs at specific intervals and update our applications to use the new CMK. 

In AWS KMS, we can enable the automatic CMK rotation. With automatic CMK rotation enabled, a new key is created with every rotation, and all new data keys are encrypted with a new CMK. 

The old CMK is not deleted and is still used for the decryption of old data keys that were created before the rotation. 

#### KMS Storage

AWS KMS key store is used as the default storage for keys managed by KMS but this storage is shared by many customers.

This may suffice most use cases. But some customers or applications may have higher security requirements. For instance, we might have to ensure our keys are isolated by using a dedicated infrastructure to ensure any regulatory compliance.

A custom key store can be configured to address these scenarios. The custom key store is associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster which is a managed Hardware Security Module (HSM) service set up in our AWS account. 

A HSM is a special hardware for cryptographic operation and storing sensitive material.

## AWS CloudHSM

AWS CloudHSM is a managed service providing a hardware security module (HSM) to generate and use our encryption keys on the AWS Cloud.

### Benefits of CloudHSM

* CloudHSM protects our keys with exclusive, single-tenant access to tamper-resistant HSM instances in our Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
* We can configure AWS KMS to use our AWS CloudHSM cluster as a custom key store instead of the default KMS key store as explained earlier.
* The HSM provided by AWS CloudHSM is based on open industry standards. This makes it easy to integrate with custom applications with standard APIs like PKCS#11, JCE, and CNG libraries and also migrate keys to and from other commercial HSM solutions.
* AWS CloudHSM provides access to HSMs over a secure channel to create users and set HSM policies so that the encryption keys which are generated and used with CloudHSM are accessible only by those HSM users.
* The AWS customer has more functionality for key management than in KMS. The customer can generate symmetric and asymmetric keys of different lengths, perform encryption with many algorithms, import and export keys, make keys non-exportable, and so on.
* If we want to encrypt data on storage it seems to be a very good solution for key management, especially if we have very
high-security requirements for our encryption. 

But CloudHSM does not have good integration with other AWS services
like KMS. Since AWS has no access to the keys in CloudHSM, it is harder to integrate than KMS, for example to use this solution for encryption of S3 objects, EFS volumes, or EBS.

### Working of CloudHSM

AWS CloudHSM runs in our VPC, enabling easy integration of HSMs with applications running on our EC2 instances. 

#### CloudHSM Cluster
For using the AWS CloudHSM service, we first create a CloudHSM Cluster that can have multiple HSMs spread across two or more Availability Zones in an AWS region. 

HSMs in a cluster are automatically synchronized and load-balanced. Each HSM appears as a network resource in our VPC. After creating and initializing a CloudHSM Cluster, we can configure a client on an EC2 instance that allows our applications to use the cluster over a secure, authenticated network connection.

#### Monitoring
CloudHSM monitors the health and network availability of our HSMs. Amazon has no access to the keys. The AWS customer has full control over the key management.

#### Secure Access
The client software maintains a secure channel to all of the HSMs in the cluster and sends requests on this channel, and the HSM performs the operations and returns the results over the secure channel. The client then returns the result to the application through the cryptographic API.

**In a CloudHSM cluster, the AWS customer has full control over the key management.** Amazon has no access to the keys. But Amazon manages and monitors the HSM. AWS takes care of backups, firmware updates synchronization, etc. 

#### Tools and SDKs
We can use command line tools
like [CloudHSM Management Utility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util.html)
for user management
and [Key Management Utility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/key_mgmt_util.html) for key
management. 

AWS provides a Client SDK for integration of the custom application with CloudHSM.


## Cost Comparison Between KMS and CloudHSM
[AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/?nc1=h_ls) is much cheaper
than [CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/pricing/?nc1=h_ls).

Every CMK in AWS KMS currently costs 1.00 USD per month. Also, we get 20,000 cryptographic requests in a month for free. If we
make more than 20,000 requests in a month it costs between 0.03 and 12.00 USD for 10,000 requests depending on the key type.

CloudHSM costs between 1.40 and 2.00 USD per hour and per device depending on the region. If we have two HSMs in the cluster for a price of 1,50 USD, we pay 72 USD per day.

If we want to use a custom key store in KMS we have to pay for both.

## Encryption of Storages

Now that we know how to manage our encryption keys in AWS, let's go over AWS storage types and look at how we can encrypt the data on these
storages.

### Amazon Elastic File System

AWS EFS is a serverless file storage service for use with AWS compute services and on-premise servers.

When we create a new file system from AWS Console, encryption at rest is enabled by default. With encryption enabled, every time we want to write or read data, KMS will perform encrypt or decrypt operations on that data. 

EFS uses customer master keys (CMKs) to encrypt our file system. It uses the AWS managed CMK for Amazon EFS stored under `aws/elasticfilesystem`, to encrypt and decrypt the file system metadata. We choose the CMK to encrypt and decrypt file data (actual file contents). This CMK can be one of the two types:
1. AWS-managed CMK: This is the default CMK `aws/elasticfilesystem`. We do not pay only for the usage.
2. Customer-managed CMK: With this CMK type, we can configure the key policies and grants for multiple users or services. If we use a customer-managed CMK as our master key for file data encryption and decryption, we can enable key rotation.

It is important to know that we have to decide on encryption while creating an EFS. We can set it only at the time of creating the file system. **It is not possible to disable or enable the encryption after creation**.

### Amazon FSx

Amazon FSx is used as Windows storage for Windows servers. Amazon FSx file systems are encrypted at rest with keys managed using AWS KMS. Data is encrypted before being written to the file system and decrypted when it is read.

Amazon FSx uses CMKs to encrypt our file system. We choose the CMK to encrypt and decrypt file systems (both data and metadata). 

Similar to EFS storage we can use the default CMK of KMS, which is called `aws/fsx`, or use a customer-managed CMK.

### Amazon Elastic Block Store

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is the block-level storage solution of AWS which is attached as volumes to EC2 instances. 

Amazon EBS encryption uses AWS KMS keys when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. The whole procedure for encryption is very similar to other service services. We have a choice between the default AWS-managed key or Custom Master Key.

Using EBS we can create snapshots of the volume. If we encrypt the volume, the snapshots that we create are automatically encrypted.

If we create a volume from a snapshot and this snapshot is encrypted, then our new volume will be automatically encrypted as well. If we create a volume from a snapshot and this snapshot is not encrypted, we again have the choice of which key we can use for encryption.

### Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is a highly scalable object storage, which we can use to store and retrieve any amount of data. It is a key-based object-store. Objects are organized in buckets which are resources similar to folders.

#### Protecting the Data at Rest
We have the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon S3:

1. **Server-side encryption**: We request S3 to encrypt our object before saving it on disks in its data centers and then decrypt it when we fetch the objects.

2. **Client-side encryption**: The complete encryption process is managed on the client side. We encrypt the data before uploading the encrypted data to S3.

#### Encryption Options on the Server-Side
We have three options for server-side encryption:

1. **Using S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)**: Each object is encrypted with a unique key and the encryption key is further encrypted with a master key that is regularly rotated by S3.
2. **Using Customer Master Keys (CMKs) stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)**: It is similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits provided by the AWS KMS service. We get the additional protection of the stored objects from unauthorized access as well as an audit trail of the usage of CMK for object retrieval.
3. **Using Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)**: We manage the encryption keys and S3 manages the encryption when it writes to disks, and decryption, when we fetch our objects. We send the key with the upload request when writing objects to S3.

#### S3 Bucket Key
Among the server-side encryption options, SSE-KMS is most expensive particularly for buckets with a large number of objects or objects with high read frequency since we pay for every cryptographical request to KMS. 

**S3 Bucket Key allows us to reduce the costs for cryptographic operation with S3 objects.**

A bucket key is a symmetric key, that is created at the bucket level. It is encrypted once by a CMK in KMS and returned to the S3 service. Now, the S3 service can generate data keys for every object and encrypt them with a bucket key outside KMS.
This way the volume of traffic to AWS KMS from the S3 storage service gets reduced thereby reducing the number of cryptographic operations with KMS.

#### Modifying the Encryption Options
Unlike the other storage service, we can change encryption options after the encryption for every object for example from SSE-S3 to SSE-KMS.

We can also encrypt every S3 object differently during upload using REST API or AWS SDK. For example, we can have three files. The first file could be encrypted using SSE-S3, the second file using SSE-KMS, and the third with SSE-C.

## Conclusion

AWS provides many solutions for the protection of the data in the cloud using server-side encryption. The AWS Key Management Service has a very simple interface and good integration with the storage services of AWS. 

AWS CloudHSM provides a solution for more stringent security requirements. It is possible to combine both these services for secure key management. 

The storage services like EFS, FSx, EBS, and S3 can be easily and securely protected with help of AWS KMS and CloudHSM services.
