A unit test is used to verify the smallest part of an application (a "unit") independent of other parts. This makes the verification process easy and fast since the scope of the testing is narrowed down to a class or method. 

The `@TestConfiguration` annotation is a useful aid for writing unit tests of components in a Spring Boot application. It allows us to define additional beans or override existing beans in the Spring application context to add specialized configurations for testing. 

In this article, we will see the use of the `@TestConfiguration` annotation for writing unit tests for a Spring Boot applications.

## Introducing the `@TestConfiguration` Annotation

We use [`@TestConfiguration`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/context/TestConfiguration.html) to modify Spring's application context during test runtime. We can use it to override certain bean definitions, for example to replace real beans with fake beans or to change the configuration of a bean to make it better testable.

We can best understand the `@TestConfiguration` annotation by first looking at the `@Configuration` annotation which is the parent annotation it inherits from. 

Before that, let us create a Spring Boot project with the help of the [Spring Boot Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.5.0.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=io.reflectoring.springboot.testconfiguration&artifactId=spring-boot-test-configuration&name=spring-boot-test-configuration&description=Project%20for%20Spring%20Boot%20Test%20Configuration&packageName=io.reflectoring.springboot.testconfiguration.spring-boot-test-configuration&dependencies=webflux), and then open the project in our favorite IDE. 

We have added a dependency on Spring WebFlux in this project since we will work around configuring a bean for `WebClient` in different ways in the test environment for accessing REST APIs. [`WebClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.3.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-webclient.html) is a non-blocking, reactive client to perform HTTP requests.

We will use this project to create our service class and bean configurations and then write tests using the `@TestConfiguration` annotation.

## Configuring a Test with @Configuration

Let us look at the structure of a unit test in Spring Boot where we define the beans in a configuration class annotated with the `@Configuration` annotation: 

```java
@Configuration
public class WebClientConfiguration {
 ...
    @Bean
    public WebClient getWebClient
      (final WebClient.Builder builder,
      @Value("${data.service.endpoint}") String url) {

        WebClient webClient = builder.baseUrl(url)
          .defaultHeader(
                  HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, 
                  MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
          // more configurations and customizations
          ...
          .build();
     

        LOGGER.info("WebClient Bean Instance: {}", webClient);
        return webClient;
    }
 }
```
In this code snippet, we configure the `WebClient` bean to run requests against an external URL. We will next define a service class where we will inject this `WebClient` bean to call a REST API:

```java
@Service
public class DataService {
    ...
    private final WebClient webClient;

    public DataService(final WebClient webClient) {

        this.webClient = webClient;
        LOGGER.info("WebClient instance {}", this.webClient);
    }
 }
 ```
In this code snippet, the `WebClient` bean is injected into the `DataService` class. During testing, a `WebClient` instance configured to use a different URL will be injected rather than the actual `WebClient` bean.

We will now create our test class and annotate it with `SpringBootTest`. **This results in bootstrapping of the full application context containing the beans selected by component scanning.** Due to this, we can inject any bean from the application context by [autowiring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html) the bean into our test class:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@TestPropertySource(locations="classpath:test.properties")
class TestConfigurationExampleAppTests {
    @Autowired
    private DataService dataService;
    ...
 }
```
In this code snippet, the `DataService` bean injected in the test class uses the `WebClient` bean configured with an external URL, which is defined in the property `data.service.endpoint` located in the properties file `test.properties`. **This makes our unit test dependent on an external dependency**, because the `WebClient` is accessing a remote URL. This might fail if we run our test as part of any automated test or in any other environment with restricted connectivity. 

## Configuring a Test with `@TestConfiguration`

To make our unit tests run without any dependency on an external configuration, we may want to use a modified test configuration that will connect to a locally running mock service instead of bootstrapping the actual application context. 

We do this by using the `@TestConfiguration` annotation over our configuration class being used for the test. This test configuration class can be an inner class within a test class or a separate class as shown here:

```java
@TestConfiguration
public class WebClientTestConfiguration {
    ...
    @Bean
    public WebClient getWebClient(final WebClient.Builder builder) {
        //customized for running unit tests
        WebClient webClient = builder
           .baseUrl("http://localhost") // <-- local URL
           .build();
        ...
        ...
        return webClient;
    }
 }

@SpringBootTest
@Import(WebClientTestConfiguration.class)
@TestPropertySource(locations="classpath:test.properties")
class TestConfigurationExampleAppTests {

    @Autowired
    private DataService dataService;
    ...
}
```
Here the `DataService` bean is injected in the test class and uses the `WebClient` bean configured in the test configuration class with `@TestConfiguration` annotation with local URL. This way we can execute our unit test without any dependency on an external system. 

We are also overriding the behavior of the `WebClient` bean to point to `localhost` so that we can use a local instance of the REST API only for unit testing. 

The `@TestConfiguration` annotation provides the capability for defining additional beans or for modifying the behavior of existing beans in the Spring Application Context for applying customizations primarily required for running a unit test. 

## Enabling the Bean Overriding Behavior

Every bean in the Spring application context will have one or more unique identifiers. Bean overriding is registering or defining another bean with the same identifier as a result of which the previous bean definition is overridden with a new bean implementation. 

The bean overriding feature is disabled by default from [Spring Boot 2.1](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.1-Release-Notes#bean-overriding). A [BeanDefinitionOverrideException](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/BeanDefinitionOverrideException.html) is thrown if we attempt to override one or more beans.

We should not enable this feature during application runtime. However, we need to enable this feature during testing if we want to override one or more bean definitions.

We enable this feature by enabling the application property `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding` in a resource file as shown here: 

```properties
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
```
Here we are setting the application property `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding` to `true` in our resource file:`test.properties` under test to enable bean overriding feature during testing.

## Component Scanning Behavior
Though the `@TestConfiguration` annotation inherits from the `@Configuration` annotation, the main difference is that `@TestConfiguration` is excluded during Spring Boot's [component scanning](https://reflectoring.io/spring-component-scanning/).

**Configuration classes annotated with `@TestConfiguration` are excluded from component scanning**, so we need to import them explicitly in every test where we want to autowire them. 

The `@TestConfiguration` annotation is also annotated with the [@TestComponent](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/context/TestComponent.html) annotation in its definition to indicate that this annotation should only be used for testing.

## Using `@TestConfiguration` in Unit Tests
As explained earlier, we can use the `@TestConfiguration` annotation in two ways during testing:
1. Import test configuration using the `Import` annotation
2. Declaring `@TestConfiguration` as a static inner class


### Using `@TestConfiguration` with the `@Import` Annotation
The `Import` annotation is a class-level annotation that allows us to import the bean definitions from multiple classes annotated with the `@Configuration` annotation or `@TestConfiguration` annotation into the application context or Spring test context:

```java
@TestConfiguration
public class WebClientTestConfiguration {
    ...
    @Bean
    public WebClient getWebClient(final WebClient.Builder builder) {
       //customized for running unit tests
        WebClient webClient = builder
              .baseUrl("http://localhost")
              .build();
        ...
        ...
        return webClient;
    }
}

@SpringBootTest
@Import(WebClientTestConfiguration.class)
class TestConfigurationExampleAppTests {
 // Test case implementations
}
```
In this code snippet, our test configuration is defined in a separate class `WebClientTestConfiguration` which is annotated with the `@TestConfiguration` annotation. We then use the `Import` annotation in our test class `TestConfigurationExampleAppTests` to import this test configuration.

We should use the autowired injection to access the bean definitions declared in imported `@TestConfiguration` classes.

### Using `@TestConfiguration` with a Static Inner Class

In this approach, the class annotated with `@TestConfiguration` is implemented as a static inner class in the test class itself:

**The Spring Boot test context will automatically discover it and load the test configuration** if it is declared as a static inner class:

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class UsingStaticInnerTestConfiguration {

 @TestConfiguration
 public static class WebClientConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public WebClient getWebClient(final WebClient.Builder builder) {
        return builder.baseUrl("http://localhost").build();
    }
 }

 @Autowired
 private DataService dataService;

 // Test methods of dataService

}
```
The test configuration is defined as a static inner class in this test. Here we do not need to import the test configuration explicitly.


## Conclusion

In this post, we looked at how we can use the `@TestConfiguration` annotation for creating a custom bean or for overriding an existing bean for unit testing of Spring applications. 

Although we have talked of unit tests here, we can also use `@TestConfiguration` in integration tests to add specialized bean configurations required for component interactions in specific test environments.

Here is a summary of the things we covered:

1. `@TestConfiguration` annotation allows us to define additional beans or override existing beans in the Spring application context to add specialized configuration for testing.
2. We can use the `@TestConfiguration` annotation in two ways during testing: 
- Declare the configuration in a separate class and then import the configuration in the test class
- Declare the configuration in a static inner class inside the test class
3. The bean overriding feature is disabled by default. We enable this feature by switching on an application property `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding` in our test.
