## What Customers Say

> Tom and the Reflectoring brand represent a fantastic opportunity for any organization such as ours that is seeking to build authentic engagement with a developer audience. This is primarily the case because he writes so clearly from a "for developers by developers" perspective. The use cases and the value streams are optimized for real-world consumption and even implementation. In addition to this practical, hands-on approach with individual posts, the content offered across the Reflectoring site and in its email newsletter is positive, encouraging and insightful.

## Exclusive Ad Placement

You get to be the exclusive advertiser on reflectoring for a time. Exclusive meaning the only *external* advertiser, as I will still show ads for my own products.

You can place the following ads:

* a skyscraper ad at the top of the right sidebar (any size up to 260 x 600 pixels)
* an in-content banner ad about half-way through the page (any size up to 720 x 300 pixels)

These ads will appear on all content pages across reflectoring.

You provide the images for the ads and a URL where they should link. Or, you just provide a logo, a text message, and a URL, and I will create the ads from that.

I'm happy to discuss other options as well.

## Sponsored Blog Post

I will write a technical blog post about your product or framework and make sure that the article is search engine optimized for it to get the most traffic possible.

The article solves a specific problem that users would be searching for via search engines in order to provide value to my developer audience. Some example ideas:

* "Complete Guide to Authentication and Authorization with &lt;Product X&gt; and Spring Boot" (if your product is an auth provider)
* "Implement Logging with &lt;Product Y&gt; and Java" (if your product is a logging provider)
* "Testing with &lt;Product Z&gt; in Kotlin" (if your product is a testing tool)

The finished article will be a well-structured, learning-friendly deep dive into the topic and have something between 1,500 and 2,000 words. It will include code examples from a working example application that I will write myself and host on GitHub.

I'm happy to discuss ideas with you so we can choose a topic that we think will have the most impact.

You can provide me with URLs to link to in the text and I will place them where they make the most sense to the reader.

Also, I will include a link and an intro to the article in my weekly newsletter.

## Sponsored Newsletter

You leave a message to the audience of my weekly newsletter.

The newsletter usually contains a link to the latest article on the page, together with a short inspirational text from me ([see examples here](/simplify)).

You provide a logo and a message of up to about 60 words, plus a URL to link to, and it will show up as the first thing in the newsletter.

I can also write the message myself, including an authentic endorsement for your product, making it much more effective. To stay authentic, I only write endorsements for products which I have used myself and which have proven their value to me.
