AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service by which we can combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build complex business applications. 

We can author the orchestration logic in a declarative style using a JSON-based format called the Amazon States Language(ASL). AWS Step functions also provides a Workflow Studio where we can define and run our workflows.

In this article, we will introduce the concepts of AWS Step Functions and understand its working with the help of an example.

## Step Functions: Basic Concepts
Let us first understand some basic concepts of Step Functions. 
### State Machine, State, and Transitions
A state machine is a mathematical model of computation consisting of different states connected with transitions. AWS Step functions also implement a state machine to represent the orchestration logic. Each step of the orchestration is represented by a state in the state machine and connected to one or more states through transitions. 

They are represented by a diagram to visualize the current state of a system as shown here:

{{% image alt="State Machine" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/sm.png" %}}
 State machines contain at least one state. Transitions represent different events that allow the system to transition from one state to another state. They also have a `start` position from where the execution can start and one or more `end` positions where the execution can end. 

### Amazon State Language (ASL)
We define a state machine in JSON format in a structure known as the Amazon States Language (ASL). The `state` is the fundamental element in ASL. The fields of a `state` object vary depending on the type of the state but the fields: `Type`, `Next`, `InputPath`, and `OutputPath` are common in states of any type. A `state` object in ASL looks like this:

```json
{
  "Type": "Task",
  "Next": "My next state",
  "InputPath": "$",
  "OutputPath": "$",
  "Comment": "My State"
}
```
In this state object, we have specified the type of state as `Task` and provided the name of the next state to execute as `My next state`. The fields: `InputPath` and `OutputPath` are filters for input and output data of the state which we will understand in a separate section. 

The ASL contains a collection of `state` objects. It has the following mandatory fields:
* `States`: This field contains a set of `state` objects. Each element of the set is a key-value pair with the name of the state as `key` and an associated `state` object as the value. 
* `StartAt`: This field contains the name of one of the state objects in the `States` collection from where the state machine will start execution.

Amazon States Language (ASL) also has optional fields:
* `Comment`: Description of state machine
* `TimeoutSeconds`: The maximum number of seconds an execution of the state machine can run beyond which the execution fails with an error.
* `Version`: Version of the Amazon States Language used to define the state machine which is `1.0` by default.

An example of a state machine defined in ASL is shown below:
```json
{
  "Comment": "Example State Machine",
  "StartAt": "state1",
  "States": {
    "state1": {...},
    "state2": {...},
    "state3": {...}
  }
}
```
This structure has the `States` field containing a collection of `3` state objects of names: `state1`, `state2`, and `state3`. The value of the field: `StartAt` is `state1` which means that the state machine starts execution from the state named `state1`. 

### Types of State
States receive input, perform actions to produce some output, and pass the output to other states. States are of different types which determine the nature of the functions a state can perform. Some of the commonly used types are:
1. **Task**: A state of type `task` represents a single unit of work performed by a state machine. All the work in a state machine is performed by tasks. The work is performed by using an activity or an AWS Lambda function, or by passing parameters to the API actions of other services.
2. **Parallel**: State of type `parallel` is used to trigger multiple branches of execution.
3. **Map**: We can dynamically iterate steps with a state of type `map`.
4. **Choice**: We use this type of state as decision points within a state machine to choose among multiple branches of execution.
5. **Fail or Succeed**: We can stop the execution with a failure or success.

We also have mechanisms for transforming the inputs and the outputs with JSONpath expressions. The state machine executes one state after another till it has no more states to execute. We will understand these concepts further by implementing a sample `checkout` process of an e-commerce application with a state machine. 

### Types of State Machine: Standard vs Express
We can create two types of state machine. State machine executions differ based on the type. The type of state machine cannot be changed after the state machine is created.
1. **Standard**: State machine of type: `Standard` should be used for long-running, durable, and auditable processes.
2. **Express**: State machine of type: `Express` is used for high-volume, event-processing workloads such as IoT data ingestion, streaming data processing and transformation, and mobile application backends. They can run for up to five minutes.

## Introducing The Example: Checkout Process
Let us take an example of a `checkout` process in an application. This `checkout` process will typically consist of the following steps:

|Function|Input|Output|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`fetch customer`|customer ID|Customer Data: email, mobile|Fetching Customer information|
|`fetch price`|cart items|Price of each item|Fetching Price of each item in the cart|
|`process payment`|payment type, cart items|Price of each item|Fetching Price of cart items|
|`create order`|customer ID, cart items with price|`success/failure`|Create order if payment is successful|

When we design the order in which to execute these steps, we need to consider which steps can execute in parallel and which ones are in sequence. 

We can execute the steps for `fetch customer` and `fetch price` in parallel. Once these two steps are complete, we will execute the step for `process payment`. If the payment fails, we will end the checkout process with an error. If the payment succeeds, we will create an order for the customer. The step for `process payment` can be retried a specific number of times on failures.

We will use AWS Step Function to represent this orchestration in the next sections.

## Creating the Lambda Functions for Invoking from the State Machine
Let us define skeletal Lambda functions for each of the steps of the `checkout` process. Our Lambda function to fetch the customer data looks like the following:

```js
exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) => {
    console,log(`input: ${event.customer_id}`)
    // TODO fetch from database
    callback(null,
                {
                    customer_id: event.customer_id, 
                    customer_name: "John Doe", 
                    payment_pref: "Credit Card",
                    email: "john.doe@yahoo.com", 
                    mobile: "677896678"
                }
            )
};

```
This lambda takes `customer_id` as input and returns a customer record corresponding to the `customer_id`. Since the lambda function is not the focus of this post, we are returning a hardcoded value of customer data instead of fetching it from the database.

Similarly, our Lambda function for fetching price looks like this:

```js
exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) => {
    const item_no = event.item_no
    console.log(`item::: ${item_no}`)
   
   // TODO fetch price from database
    const price = {item_no: item_no, price: "123.45", lastUpdated: "2022-06-12"}
    callback(null, price)
}

```
This Lambda takes `item_no` as input and returns a pricing record corresponding to the `item_no`. 

We will use similar Lambda functions for the other steps of the `checkout` process. All of them will have skeletal code similar to the `fetch customer` and `fetch price`.

## Defining the Checkout Process with a State Machine
After defining the Lambda functions and getting an understanding of the basic concepts of the Step Function service, let us now define our `checkout` Process. 

Let us create the state machine from the AWS management console. We can either choose to use the Workflow Studio which provides a visual workflow editor or the Amazon States Language (ASL) for defining our state machine. 
{{% image alt="checkout process" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/create_sm_1.png" %}}

Here we have selected Workflow Studio to author our state machine. We have also selected the type of state machine as `standard` in the first step. 

Let us also give a name: `checkout` to our state machine and assign an IAM role that defines which resources our state machine has permission to access during execution. Our IAM policy definition is associated with the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:InvokeFunction"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
This policy will allow the state machine to invoke any Lambda function. 

We will next add the steps of the `checkout` process in the state machine.

## Adding the States in the State Machine
Each step of the `checkout` process will be a state in the state machine. 

Let us add the steps of the `checkout` process as different states in the state machine. We will define these states as of type `task` and will call the API: `Lambda: Invoke `. 

The configuration of the state for the `fetch customer` step looks like this in the visual editor:

{{% image alt="State definition" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/state-defn.png" %}}

As we can see we have specified the name of the state as `fetch customer`,  defined the API as `Lambda:invoke`, and selected the integration type as `Optimized`. We have provided the ARN of the Lambda function as the API parameter. The corresponding definition of the state in Amazon States Language (ASL) looks like this:

```json
{
  "Comment": "state machine for checkout process",
  "StartAt": "fetch customer",
  "States": {
    "fetch customer": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke",
      "OutputPath": "$.Payload",
      "Parameters": {
        "Payload.$": "$",
        "FunctionName": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:926501103602:function:fetchCustomer:$LATEST"
      },
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```
We will add the other steps with similar configurations for invoking the corresponding Lambda functions. 

The first two steps: `fetch customer` and `fetch price` are not dependent on each other. So we can call them in parallel. 

Our state machine after adding these two steps looks like this in the visual editor:

{{% image alt="checkout process with 2 steps" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/2-steps.png" %}}

As we can see in this visual, our state machine consists of `2` states: `fetch customer` and `fetch price`. We have defined these steps as `2` branches of a state of type `parallel` which allows the state machine to execute them in parallel. 

The corresponding definition of the state machine built so far in Amazon States Language (ASL) looks like this:
```json
{
  "Comment": "state machine for checkout process",
  "StartAt": "Parallel",
  "States": {
    "Parallel": {
      "Type": "Parallel",
      "Branches": [
        {
          "StartAt": "fetch customer",
          "States": {
            "fetch customer": {
              "Type": "Task",
              "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke",
              "OutputPath": "$.Payload",
              "Parameters": {
                "Payload.$": "$",
                "FunctionName": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:926501103602:function:fetchCustomer:$LATEST"
              },
              "End": true
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "StartAt": "Map",
          "States": {
            "Map": {
              "Type": "Map",
              "Iterator": {
                "StartAt": "fetch price",
                "States": {
                  "fetch price": {
                    "Type": "Task",
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke",
                    "OutputPath": "$.Payload",
                    "Parameters": {
                      "Payload.$": "$"
                    },
                    "End": true
                  }
                }
              },
              "End": true
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "Next": "Pass"
    },
    "Pass": {
      "Type": "Pass",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```

We have put the `fetch price` state as a child state of a `map` state. The `map` state allows the state machine to iterate over each item in the cart to fetch their price by executing the task state: `fetch price`. 

We have next added a state of type: `pass` after the parallel step. The `pass` type state acts as a placeholder where we will manipulate the output from the parallel state. 

Let us add two more steps for processing payment and placing an order if the payment succeeds. Here is our state machine in the visual editor with the two additional steps: `process payment`, and `create order`:

{{% image alt="checkout process with all steps" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/workflow-full.png" %}}

We have also added a state of type `choice` with `2` branches. Each branch has a rule. The branch will execute only if the result of the rule evaluation is true.  


## Processing Inputs and Outputs in a State Machine
The input to a Step Functions is sent in JSON format which is then passed to the first state in the state machine. Each state in the state machine receives JSON data as input and usually generates JSON as output to be passed to the next state. We can associate different kinds of filters to manipulate data in each state both before and after the task processing.

### Input Filters: InputPath and Parameters 
We use the InputPath and Parameters fields to manipulate the data before task processing: 

{{% image alt="process input" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/process_input.png" %}}
1. **InputPath**: The InputPath field takes a JSONPath attribute to extract only the parts of the input which is required by the state.
2. **Parameters**: The Parameters field enables us to pass a collection of key-value pairs, where the values are either static values that we define in our state machine definition, or that are selected from the input using a path.

### Output Filters: OutputPath, ResultSelector, and ResultPath 
We can further manipulate the results of the state execution using the fields: ResultSelector, ResultPath, and OutputPath:
{{% image alt="process output" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/process_output.png" %}}
1. **ResultSelector**: This field filters the task result to construct a new JSON object using selected elements of the task result.
2. **ResultPath**: In most cases, we would like to retain the input data for processing by subsequent states of the state machine. For this, we use the ResultPath filter to add the task result to the original state input. 
3. **OutputPath**: The OutputPath filter is used to select a portion of the effective state output to pass to the next state. It is often used with Task states to filter the result of an API response.

We will next add these filters to manipulate the input data to our state machine for the `checkout` process at different stages. We will mainly manipulate the data to make prepare the requests for the different Lambda functions.

## Data Transformations through the Checkout Process State Machine
Our state machine for the `checkout` process with the input and output filters is shown below:
{{% image alt="checkout process with all steps" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/sm_with_data.png" %}}

We need to execute our state machine to run the `task` type states configured in the earlier sections. We can initiate an execution from the Step Functions console, or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or by calling the Step Functions API with the AWS SDKs. Step Functions records full execution history for 90 days after the execution completes.

We need to provide input to the state machine in JSON format during execution and receive a JSON output after execution.

We can see the list of state machine executions with information such as execution id, status, and start date in the Step Functions console. 

On selecting an execution, we can see a graph inspector which shows states and transitions marked with colors to indicate successful tasks, failures, and tasks that are still in progress. The graph inspector of our checkout process is shown below:
{{% image alt="graph inspector of checkout process with all steps" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/graph-inspector.png" %}}

Let us look at how our input data changes during the execution of the state machine by applying input and output filters as we transition through some of the states:

**Input to State Machine**:
```json
{
    "checkout_request": {
        "customer_id" : "C6238485",
        "cart_items": [
            {
                "item_no": "I1234",
                "shipping_date": "",
                "shipping_address": "address_1"
            },
            {
                "item_no": "I1235",
                "shipping_date": "",
                "shipping_address": "address_2"
            },
            {
                "item_no": "I1236",
                "shipping_date": "",
                "shipping_address": "address_3"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
This is the input to our `checkout` process which is composed of a `customer_id` and an array of items in the shopping cart:  `cart_items`.

            },
            {

                ..
            },
            {

}
```

## Handling Errors in Step Function Workflows
Let us understand some of the ways we handle errors in Step functions: 

When a state reports an error, the state machine execution fails by default.

States of type `task`, `parallel`, and `map` provide fields for configuring error handling:
{{% image alt="Error handling" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/error-handling.png" %}}
We can handle errors by retrying the operation or by a fallback to another state.

### Retrying on Error
We can retry a task when errors occur by specifying one or more retry rules, called "retriers".
{{% image alt="Error handling Retry" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/retry-error.png" %}}
Here we have defined a `retrier` for `3` types of errors: `Lambda.ServiceException`, `Lambda.AWSLambdaException`, and `Lambda.SdkClientException` with the following retry settings:
* **Interval**: The number of seconds before the first retry attempt. It can take values from `1` which is default to `99999999`.
* **Max Attempts**: The maximum number of retry attempts. The task will not be retried after the number of retries exceeds this value. `MaxAttempts` has a default value of `3` and maximum value of `99999999`.
* **Backoff Rate**: It is the multiplier by which the retry interval increases with each attempt.

### Falling Back to a Different State on Error
We can catch and revert to a fallback state when errors occur by specifying one or more catch rules, called "catchers".

In this example, we are defining a `prepare error` state to which the `process payment` state can fall back if it encounters an error of type: `States.TaskFailed`.

The state machine with a `catcher` defined for the `process payment` step looks like this in the visual editor.

### Handling Lambda Service Exceptions
As a best practice, we should proactively handle transient service errors in AWS Lambda functions that result in a `500` error, such as `ServiceException`, `AWSLambdaException`, or `SdkClientException`. We can handle these exceptions by retrying the Lambda function invocation, or by catching the error.

## Integration with AWS Services
When we configure a state of type `task` we need to specify an integration type:

{{% image alt="Error handling catcher in workflow" src="images/posts/aws-step-function/integration-type.png" %}}

We can integrate Step Function with AWS services through two types of service integrations: 

### Optimized Integrations
When we are calling an AWS service with optimized integration, Step Functions provide some additional functionality when the service API is called. For example, the invocation of the Lambda service converts its output from an escaped JSON string to a JSON object similar to the format:
```json
{
  "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST",
  "Payload": {
    ...
  },
  "SdkHttpMetadata": {
    ...
  },
  "SdkResponseMetadata": {
    "RequestId": "ac79dacd-7c6f-41c7-bfcf-eea70b43e141"
  },
  "StatusCode": 200
}
```
We had used optimized integration for invoking our Lambda functions in the state machine of the `checkout` process.
### AWS SDK Integrations
AWS SDK integrations allow us to make a standard API call on an AWS service from the state machine. When we use AWS SDK integrations, we specify the service name and API call with optionally, a service integration pattern (explained in the next section). The syntax for specifying the AWS service looks like this:
`arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:serviceName:apiAction.[serviceIntegrationPattern]`

### Integration Patterns
Step functions integrate with AWS services using three types of service integration patterns. The service integration pattern is specified by appending a suffix in the Resource URL in the task configuration.

* **Request Response**: Step Functions wait for an HTTP response and then progress to the next state immediately after it gets an HTTP response. We do not append any suffix after the resource URI for this integration pattern. We have used this integration pattern for invoking all the Lambda functions from our state machine for the `checkout` process.

* **Running a Job**: Step Functions wait for a request to complete before progressing to the next state. To specify this integration pattern, we specify the `Resource` field in our task state definition with the `.sync` suffix appended after the resource URI.

* **Waiting for a Callback with a Task Token**: A task might need to wait for various reasons like seeking human approval, integrating with a third-party workflow, or calling legacy systems. 
In these situations, we can pause Step Functions indefinitely, and wait for an external process or workflow to complete. For this integration pattern, we specify the `Resource` field in our task state definition with the `.waitForTaskToken` suffix appended after the resource URI.

## Conclusion

Here is a list of the major points for a quick reference:
1. AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service by which we can combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build complex business applications. 
2. We can author the orchestration logic in a declarative style using a JSON-based format called the Amazon States Language(ASL). 
3. AWS Step functions also provide a powerful graphical console where we can visualize our applicationâ€™s workflow as a series of steps.
4. State Machines are of two types: `Standard` and `Express`. We use `Standard` for long-running, and durable processes and `Express` for high-volume, event-processing workloads.
5. States of a state machine are of various types like `task`, `choice`, `map`, `pass` depending on the nature of functions they perform.
6. We can associate different kinds of filters to manipulate data in each state both before and after the task processing.
7. InputPath and parameters filters are used to filter input data before task execution.
8. OutputPath, ResultSelector, and ResultPath filters are used to filter the task result before preparing the output of a state.
9. We can also configure retry and fallback error handlers for handling error conditions in states.
