An application programming interface (API) is a form of a real life contract between two  software programs or applications describing and laying down the rules that they should follow to communicate with one another. 
OAS is the most accepted standard for publishing API contracts for REST APIs, still many informal means of communinicating API contracts are prevalent in the industry. However a good documentation for an API is a must have to make the API easy to understand and consume by the consumers. 

APIs have traditionally been built by first writing the implementation code in a programming language and then publishing the API contract. This is called the code first approach. In contrast to this method, we can also create the API contract first and then write the implementation code for the API. This is called the design first approach of creating APIs. The documentation of the API can accordingly evolve starting from the code or the contract depending on which approach is chosen. 

In this article, we will understand this code first approach versus the design first approach of writing the API documentation and which method should be preferred in which situations.

## Common Contents of an API Documentation
API documentation consists of a description of the API explaining what it can do along with the instructions on how to use and integrate the API. It can also include release updates with regard to the APIâ€™s lifecycle such as new versions or impending retirement. Some aspects of API documentation, in particular the functional interface, can be generated automatically using Swagger, OAS or similar specifications.
 
## The Design-First Process

In design-first API documentation process, we design and document the API contract before writing any implementation code. The API contract is treated as a first class citizen.
The API is treated as a product and the contract is designed with a focus on making it easy to use by the consumers. The API contract is developed through multiple stages. Consumers provide feedback at each stage and the API contract is matured by incorporating those feedbacks. Once the API contract is finalized, it is published in a registry and the consumers and producers work against this contract independently.
 and follows a product lifecylce.

 API definitions are typically writeen in yaml following the OAS. A sample of an OAS file looks like this:

In this model, the API specification is the artifact used to drive the rest of the development process.

Proponents of this process believe that focusing on designing the API using an OpenAPI description before any implementation is done allows you to get early feedback from API consumers who can view the documentation before the API is built.

In theory, a design-first process can help catch potential problems with the API early and avoids wasting time and money writing code which is not going to solve a problem.

API Description First involves writing your API description document as the very first step in the development process. You can use this description document to create a mock server early in the development process, get feedback from your customers, and then commit to the final API description before starting an official implementation.

With the API description document in hand, you can kick start the implementation by leveraging code generation projects that generation portions of the server and allow you to focus on implementing the business logic.

Focusing on the API description document first helps establish API design as a first class priority of engineering teams. This framing creates a lot of benefits in how teams think about APIs a core feature of the product they are developing.

The main negative Iâ€™ve found when developing API description documents is that it involves writing out a large amount of boilerplate and special keywords in YAML or JSON. This is a tedious and error-prone proposition when done by hand. For example, we can take the ubiquitous Petstore example from the OpenAPI project.

## The Code-First Process

A code-first API process focuses on implementing the API first, and then creating the API description document after the implementation. In this model, the API implementation is the source of truth for the API and drives the rest of the development process.
Proponents of this process believe that writing and maintaining an API description document is difficult and error prone, and that it slows down the development process and time to market for new APIs and new product features.

## Code First
In the code-first method, we write the API implementation code in a programming language without thinking about how the API documentation will look like.
Once the API implementation code is complete and tested, we document the API using an API description format like OpenAPI using the code as the reference.

With this code-first method, it is possible for us to start implementing the API much faster if they start coding the API directly from the product requirements document. Libraries supporting scaffolding server code, functional testing, and deployment automation can make the implementation first method quick to get started and end up with good results. When developing internal APIs that arenâ€™t exposed as a product to customers, the implementation first approach offers speed, automation and reduced process complexity.

The issue with Implementation First is that it can be a lot of work to go back and write documentation for an existing API. It can especially feel like a chore when the documentation will get out of date with the implementation as you make new changes to the API.

The primary criticismâ€™s that most people have with a Code First API development process are that:
- there isnâ€™t enough care put into API design 
- the API description will get out-of-sync with the implementation. 
When reviewing these problems against this modified continuum of API development methodologies you can see that only the very last method, which I am calling Implementation First suffers from these problems.

## Different Types of APIs
APIs are not all equal, however. Developers can work with an assortment of API types, protocols and architectures that suit the unique needs of different applications and businesses.
APIs come in several types depending on the intent of their use:
**Public API**: Example of public API are APIs from
