In this article, we'll discuss all that entails <em>KDoc</em> in Kotlin. [KDoc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html#links-to-elements) is simply a language used to document code written in Kotlin specifically. KDoc allows us to provide documentation comments for classes, functions, properties and other elements in our code. It's the same as <em>Javadoc</em> which is used to document JAVA language. Essentially, <em>KDoc</em> combines syntax in <em>Javadoc </em>for the block tags and markdown for inline markup.
## KDoc Syntax
Same as <em>javadoc, </em>KDoc comments usually start with /** and end with */.

Let’s see an example of KDoc:
```groovy
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param a The first number.
 * @param b The second number.
 * @return The sum of the two numbers.
 */
fun sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```
KDoc in our example is written above our <em>sum</em> function. In this case, KDoc explains what task our function performs and also documents the parameters <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> which the function takes inclusive of the expected return value.

Note that, different from JavaDoc, KDoc supports Markdown syntax.

## KDoc Block Tags
Block tags are used to provide documentation for larger sections of code or to describe multi-line content within KDoc.They are usually placed on separate lines.

These are the block tags supported by KDoc:

| Tag | Description |
|--------|---------------------------|
|**@param**            | This tag is used to document a value parameter of a function |
|**@return**           |Used to document the return value of a function |
|**@constructor**      |Used to document the primary constructor of a class |
|**@receiver**         |Documents the receiver of an extension function |
|**@property**         |This tag is used to document the property of a class that has the specified name |
|**@throws,@exception**| Used to document exceptions that can be thrown by a method |
|**@sample**           |Used to embed the body of a function that has the specified qualified name|
|**@see**              | Used to add a link to a specific class or method |
|**@author**           | Used to specify the author of the element that is being documented |
|**@since**            | Used to specify the version of the software in which the element under documentation was introduced |

**KDoc does not support the <code class="code ">@deprecated</code> tag. Instead, please use the <code class="code ">@Deprecated</code> annotation.**

Code block example with block tags supported by KDoc:

```groovy
/**
 * A list of movies.
 *
 * This class is just a **documentation example**.
 *
 * @param T the type of movie in this list.
 * @property name the name of this movie list.
 * @constructor creates an empty movie list.
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception
 * @sample https://www.thetoptens.com/movies/best-movies/
 */
class MovieList<T>(private val name: String) {

    private var movies: MutableList<T> = mutableListOf()

    /**
     * Adds a [movie] to this list.
     * @return the new number of movies in the list.
     */
    fun add(movie: T): Int {
        movies.add(movie)
        return movies.size
    }
}

/**
 * A movie with a title.
 *
 * @property title the title of this movie.
 * @constructor creates a movie with a title.
 */
data class Movie(private val title: String)

private fun movieListSample() {
    val movieList = MovieList<Movie>("My Favorite Movies")
    val movieCount = movieList.add(Movie("Inception"))
}
```

## Conclusion
In this article, we discussed KDoc which is the documentation language for Kotlin code. We also went through the KDOc's syntax and the various tags it supports.
