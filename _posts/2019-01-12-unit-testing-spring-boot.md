Writing good unit tests can be considered an art that is hard to master. But the
good news is that the mechanics supporting it are easy to learn. 

This tutorial
provides you with these mechanics and goes into the technical details that are necessary
to write good unit tests with a focus on Spring Boot applications. 

We'll have a look at how to create Spring beans in a testable manner and then discuss 
usage of Mockito and AssertJ, both libraries that Spring Boot by default includes for
testing. 

Note that this article only discusses *unit tests*. Integration tests, tests of the web layer
and tests of the persistence layer will be discussed in upcoming articles of this series.

## The "Testing with Spring Boot" Series

This tutorial is part of a series:

1. [Unit Testing with Spring Boot](/unit-testing-spring-boot/)
2. [Testing Spring MVC Web Controllers with Spring Boot and `@WebMvcTest`](/spring-boot-web-controller-test/)
3. [Testing JPA Queries with Spring Boot and `@DataJpaTest`](/spring-boot-data-jpa-test/)
4. [Integration Tests with `@SpringBootTest`](/spring-boot-test/)

**If you like learning from videos, make sure to check out Philip's** [**Testing Spring Boot Applications Masterclass**](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/13745/194393) (if you buy through this link, I get a cut). 

## Dependencies

For the unit test in this tutorial, we'll use JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5), Mockito, and 
AssertJ. We'll also include Lombok to reduce a bit of boilerplate code:

```groovy
dependencies{
  compileOnly('org.projectlombok:lombok')
  testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')
  testCompile 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.2.0'
  testCompile('org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:2.23.0')
}
```

Mockito and AssertJ are automatically imported with the `spring-boot-starter-test` dependency, but
we'll have to include Lombok ourselves.
 
## Don't Use Spring in Unit Tests 

If you have written tests with Spring or Spring Boot in the past, **you'll probably say that
we don't need Spring to write unit tests**. Why is that?

Consider the following "unit" test that tests a single method of the `RegisterUseCase` class:

```java
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest
class RegisterUseCaseTest {

  @Autowired
  private RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

  @Test
  void savedUserHasRegistrationDate() {
    User user = new User("zaphod", "zaphod@mail.com");
    User savedUser = registerUseCase.registerUser(user);
    assertThat(savedUser.getRegistrationDate()).isNotNull();
  }

}
```

[comment]: # (add cross reference - https://gitlab.com/thombergs/reflectoring/issues/171)

This test takes about 4.5 seconds to run on an empty Spring project on my computer. 

**But a good unit test only takes milliseconds.** Otherwise it hinders the "test / code / test" flow
promoted by the idea of Test-Driven Development (TDD). But even when we're not practicing TDD,
waiting on a test that takes too long ruins our concentration.

Execution of the test method above actually only takes milliseconds. The rest of the 4.5 seconds is due to the `@SpringBootRun` 
telling Spring Boot to set up a whole Spring Boot application context.
 
**So we have started the whole application only to autowire a `RegisterUseCase`
instance into our test**. It will take even longer once the application gets bigger and Spring
has to load more and more beans into the application context. 

So, why this article when we shouldn't use Spring Boot in a unit test? To be honest, most of this tutorial
is about writing unit tests *without* Spring Boot.

## Creating a Testable Spring Bean

However, there are some things we can do to make our Spring beans better testable.

### Field Injection is Evil

Let's start with a bad example. Consider the following class:

```java
@Service
public class RegisterUseCase {

  @Autowired
  private UserRepository userRepository;

  public User registerUser(User user) {
    return userRepository.save(user);
  }

}
```

This class cannot be unit tested without Spring because it provides no way to pass in a `UserRepository`
instance. Instead, we need to write the test in the way discussed in the previous section to let
Spring create a `UserRepository` instance and inject it into the field annotated with `@Autowired`. 

**The lesson here is not to use field injection.** 

### Providing a Constructor
 
Actually let's not use the `@Autowired` annotation at all:

```java
@Service
public class RegisterUseCase {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;

  public RegisterUseCase(UserRepository userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }

  public User registerUser(User user) {
    return userRepository.save(user);
  }

}
```

This version allows [constructor injection](/constructor-injection) by providing a constructor that allows to pass 
in a `UserRepository` instance. In the unit test, we can now
create such an instance (perhaps a mock instance as we'll discuss later) and pass it into the constructor.

Spring will automatically use this constructor to instantiate a `RegisterUseCase` object when creating
the production application context. Note that prior to Spring 5, we need to add the `@Autowired` annotation to
the constructor for Spring to find the constructor. 

Also note that the `UserRepository` field is now `final`. This makes sense, since the field content 
won't ever change during the lifetime of an application. It also helps to avoid programming
errors, because the compiler will complain if we have forgotten to initialize the field.

### Reducing Boilerplate Code

Using Lombok's [`@RequiredArgsConstructor`](https://projectlombok.org/features/constructor)
annotation we can let the constructor be automatically generated:

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class RegisterUseCase {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;

  public User registerUser(User user) {
    user.setRegistrationDate(LocalDateTime.now());
    return userRepository.save(user);
  }

}
```

Now, we have a very concise class without boilerplate code that can be instantiated easily in 
a plain java test case:

```java
class RegisterUseCaseTest {

  private UserRepository userRepository = ...;

  private RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

  @BeforeEach
  void initUseCase() {
    registerUseCase = new RegisterUseCase(userRepository);
  }

  @Test
  void savedUserHasRegistrationDate() {
    User user = new User("zaphod", "zaphod@mail.com");
    User savedUser = registerUseCase.registerUser(user);
    assertThat(savedUser.getRegistrationDate()).isNotNull();
  }

}
```

There's a piece missing, yet, and that is how to mock away the `UserRepository` instance
our class under test depends on, because we don't want to rely on the real thing, which
probably needs a connection to a database.

## Using Mockito to Mock Dependencies

The de-facto standard mocking library nowadays is [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/).
It provides at least two ways to create a mocked `UserRepository` to fill the blank in the previous code example.

### Mocking Dependencies with Plain Mockito

The first way is to just use Mockito programmatically:

```java
private UserRepository userRepository = Mockito.mock(UserRepository.class);
``` 

This will create an object that looks like a `UserRepository` from the outside. **By default, it will
do nothing when a method is called and return `null` if the method has a return value**.

Our test would now fail with a `NullPointerException` at `assertThat(savedUser.getRegistrationDate()).isNotNull()`
because `userRepository.save(user)` now returns `null`.

So, we have to tell Mockito to return something when `userRepository.save()` is called. We do this with the static `when`
method:

```java
@Test
void savedUserHasRegistrationDate() {
  User user = new User("zaphod", "zaphod@mail.com");
  when(userRepository.save(any(User.class))).then(returnsFirstArg());
  User savedUser = registerUseCase.registerUser(user);
  assertThat(savedUser.getRegistrationDate()).isNotNull();
}
```

This will make `userRepository.save()` return the same user object that is passed into
the method.

Mockito has a whole lot more features that allow for mocking, matching arguments and verifying method calls.
For more information have a look at 
the [reference documentation](https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.23.4/org/mockito/Mockito.html).

## Mocking Dependencies with Mockito's `@Mock` Annotation

An alternative way of creating mock objects is Mockito's `@Mock` annotation in combination with 
the `MockitoExtension` for JUnit Jupiter:

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class RegisterUseCaseTest {

  @Mock
  private UserRepository userRepository;

  private RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

  @BeforeEach
  void initUseCase() {
    registerUseCase = new RegisterUseCase(userRepository);
  }

  @Test
  void savedUserHasRegistrationDate() {
    // ...
  }

}
```

The `@Mock` annotation specifies the fields in which Mockito should inject mock objects. The `@MockitoExtension`
tells Mockito to evaluate those `@Mock` annotations because JUnit does not do this automatically.

The result is the same as if calling `Mockito.mock()` manually, it's a matter of taste which way to use. Note, though,
that by using `MockitoExtension` our tests are bound to the test framework. 

Note that instead of constructing an `RegisterUseCase` object manually, we can just as well use the `@InjectMocks` 
annotation on the `registerUseCase` field. Mockito will then create an instance for us,
following a specified [algorithm](https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.23.4/org/mockito/InjectMocks.html):

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class RegisterUseCaseTest {

  @Mock
  private UserRepository userRepository;

  @InjectMocks
  private RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

  @Test
  void savedUserHasRegistrationDate() {
    // ...
  }

}
```

## Creating Readable Assertions with AssertJ

Another library that comes automatically with the Spring Boot test support is [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/).
We have already used it above to implement our assertion:

```java
assertThat(savedUser.getRegistrationDate()).isNotNull();
```

However, wouldn't it be nice to make the assertion even more readable? Like this, for example:

```java
assertThat(savedUser).hasRegistrationDate();
``` 

There are many cases where small changes like this make the test so much better to understand.
So, let's create our own [custom assertion](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-custom-assertions.html)
**in the test sources folder**:

```java
class UserAssert extends AbstractAssert<UserAssert, User> {

  UserAssert(User user) {
    super(user, UserAssert.class);
  }

  static UserAssert assertThat(User actual) {
    return new UserAssert(actual);
  }

  UserAssert hasRegistrationDate() {
    isNotNull();
    if (actual.getRegistrationDate() == null) {
      failWithMessage(
        "Expected user to have a registration date, but it was null"
      );
    }
    return this;
  }
}
```

Now, if we import the `assertThat` method from the new `UserAssert` class instead from
the AssertJ library, we can use the new, easier to read assertion.

Creating a custom assertion like this may seem like a lot of work, but it's actually done in a couple minutes.
I believe strongly that it's worth to invest these minutes to create readable test code, even if it's
only marginally better readable afterwards. **We only write the test code *once*, after all, and others
(including "future me") have to read, understand and then manipulate the code many, many times during the lifetime of the software**.

If it still seems like too much work, have a look at AssertJ's 
[Assertions Generator](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-assertions-generator.html).

## Conclusion

There are reasons to start up a Spring application in a test, but for plain unit tests, it's not
necessary. It's even harmful due to the longer turnaround times. Instead, we should build our Spring
beans in a way that easily supports writing plain unit tests for.

The [Spring Boot Test Starter](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.springframework.boot%20AND%20a:spring-boot-starter-test&core=gav)
comes with Mockito and AssertJ as testing libraries. 

Let's exploit those testing libraries to create expressive unit tests!
