# Get Familiar With Java Records
In the constantly changing world of Java programming, simplicity is the most desired approach. Java records transform the way we manage data classes, simplifying the complicated and reducing the verbosity.

## What are Java Records?
Java records are a special kind of class introduced in Java 14. They are tailored for simplicity, designed to encapsulate data without the clutter of boilerplate code. **With a concise syntax, records enable us to create immutable data holders effortlessly.**

## Why Records?
Traditionally, Java classes representing data structures contained repetitive code for methods such as equals(), hashCode(), toString(), getter methods, and public constructors. This resulted in bloated classes, making the codebase more difficult to read, maintain, and extend. Java records were introduced as a solution, simplifying the creation of data-centric classes and addressing the issues of verbosity and redundancy.

There are several benefits to using Java records:

1. **Simplicity**: One of the key advantages of records is their ability to create simple data objects without the need for writing extensive boilerplate code. With records, you can define the structure of your data concisely and straightforwardly.
2. **Immutability by Default**: Java records are immutable by default, meaning that once you create a record, you cannot modify its fields. This immutability ensures data integrity and makes it easier to reason about the state of your objects.
3. **Conciseness and Readability**: Java records offer a more concise and readable syntax compared to traditional Java classes. The streamlined syntax of records allows you to define your data fields and their types in a compact and visually appealing way, making it easier to understand and maintain your code.

In summary, Java records provide a powerful and efficient way to create data-centric classes. They simplify the process of defining and working with data objects, promote immutability, and enhance code readability. By leveraging the benefits of records, you can write cleaner and more maintainable code in your Java projects.

## A Glimpse into History: The Evolution of Java Records
- *Java 14 (March 2020):* Records made their first appearance as a preview feature, giving us a glimpse into the exciting future of simplified Java.
- *Java 15 and 16:* Records kept evolving and improving, thanks to the valuable feedback from the community.
- *Java 16 (March 2021):* Records were officially established as a standard feature, indicating their readiness to shine in Java applications.

With Java records, you can experience a shift from complexity to clarity in Java programming. In the following sections, we will dive into the details of Java records, including their syntax, use cases, and how they can bring elegance to our code. Prepare to witness the power of writing less code and accomplishing more!

{{% info title="Notes on Perview Enablement And Why We Need To Know It" %}}

- For Java versions before 14, records are not available as a language feature.
- For Java versions 14, 15, or between 14 and 16, we need to use the --enable-preview flag to use records.
- For Java versions 16 and above, records are a standard feature, and the --enable-preview flag is not required for using records.

If we are using Java version between 14 and 16 and we want to use Java records, we can enable preview features using the `--enable-preview` flag during compilation and execution. This allows us to use records even though they were in preview status during that specific version.

The `--enable-preview` flag and preview features in Java allow us to use and experiment with language features and APIs that are not yet stable and finalized.

**Preview features are introduced in a specific Java version but are not considered part of the official language specification until they are finalized in a subsequent release.**

This mechanism enables us to provide feedback on these features before they become a permanent part of the Java language.

Here's how we can use `--enable-preview`:

**Compilation:**
```bash
javac --enable-preview --release 14 SomeFile.java
```

**Execution:**
```bash
java --enable-preview SomeClass
```

In the above commands:
- `--enable-preview` enables preview features during compilation and execution.
- `--release 14` specifies the Java version we are targeting. Replace `14` with the appropriate version number if we are using a different version of Java.

It is important to note that when using preview features, we might encounter changes or improvements in subsequent Java versions, and the syntax or behavior of these features could be refined before they become permanent parts of the language.

ðŸ‘‰ Always check the official Java documentation and release notes for the specific version we are using to understand the details of the preview features and any changes made in subsequent releases.

The configurations for IDEs depend on the IDE we are using. For example, if we are using Intellij Idea IDE, we can configure it to use JDK 14 for Project SDK and choose the Project language level as `14 (Preview) â€“ Records, patterns, text blocks` for our Project and Modules settings.

When we want to create record in Intellij IDE, we can use create new class dialog (select the project or package and click `ALT+INSERT`) and select `Record` from the types list.

Once we create a record, and want to customize it, open the Java file and use code generation dialog (click `ALT+INSERT`), and select one of the options - Constructor, Getter, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Refer IDE documentation for specific details on code generation and other developer tools provided for implementing records.

## Reasons to Use Java Records
Let's explore the challenges we face and how Java records can help solve them. We'll also take a closer look at the syntax of Java records to gain a better understanding.

### Challenges Faced by Developers

Creating and maintaining data-centric classes in Java traditionally required substantial effort.

1. **Verbosity Overload:**
   Traditional Java classes required us to write verbose code for basic functionalities like `constructor`, `gettter`, `setter`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. This verbosity cluttered the code, making it difficult to read and understand.

```java
// Verbose Java class
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // Manually written equals() method
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        // Manually written hashCode() method
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        // Manually written toString() method
        // ...
    }
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

1. **Boilerplate Fatigue:**
Writing repetitive boilerplate code was not only time-consuming but also error-prone. Any change in the class structure meant manually updating multiple methods, leading to maintenance nightmares.

1. **Immutability Hassles:**
Ensuring immutability, a key aspect of data integrity, demanded additional effort. We had to meticulously design classes to make them immutable, often leading to complex and convoluted code.

### Java Records: The Solution to the Challenges

1. **Conciseness Redefined:**
   Java records introduce a concise syntax that automates the generation of essential methods. They eliminate the need for boilerplate code, allowing us to focus on the core logic of their applications.

1. **Immutability by Default:**
   Records are inherently immutable, meaning once created, their state cannot be changed. This immutability is a fundamental property, ensuring data integrity without us having to enforce it manually.

1. **Automatic Method Generation:**
   Records automatically generate methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. This automation simplifies the development process, making classes more maintainable and reducing the chances of human error.

1. **Enhanced Readability and Maintainability:**
   With reduced boilerplate and enhanced clarity, Java records improve code readability. Classes become concise, allowing us to grasp the structure and purpose of data classes at a glance.

## Syntax of Java Records

Let's dive into the syntax of Java records, covering its key elements, various types of constructors, methods, and how records compare with traditional Java classes.

Let's explore the basic syntax of Java records:

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Constructor and methods are automatically generated.
}
```

In this example, `Person` is a Java record with two components: `name` (a `String`) and `age` (an `int`). The `record` keyword signifies the creation of a record class. Java records automatically generate the constructor, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods based on the components specified in the parentheses.

Here's a breakdown of the essential components.

### Record Keyword and Components

The `record` keyword is used to indicate the creation of a record class. In object-oriented programming, a record class is a data structure that contains multiple `components`. These components, which can be thought of as the data fields of the record, are declared within parentheses. By using the record keyword, developers can easily define and work with structured data in their programs.
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Record body
}
```
In this particular example, we have a Java record called `Person`. This record consists of two main components: `name`, which is a String data type, and `age`, which is an int data type. The `name` component represents the person's name, while the `age` component represents their age in years. By using the `Person` record, we can conveniently store and access information about individuals in our Java program.

### Types of Constructors

1. **Compact Constructor:**
   A compact constructor is automatically generated based on the components. This constructor plays a vital role in the initialization process of the components, ensuring that they are properly set up and ready to be used.
   
   By automatically handling the initialization, it saves developers valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually setting up each component.
   
   Additionally, the compact constructor also guarantees immutability, ensuring that once the components are initialized, their values cannot be changed. This immutability is crucial in maintaining data integrity and preventing accidental modifications that could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Compact constructor is automatically generated
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
```

2. **Canonical Constructor:**
    A canonical constructor enables developers to add custom logic during object initialization. This constructor is explicitly declared within the record and can perform additional operations beyond the standard initialization process.

    This feature can be particularly useful in situations where the standard initialization process is not sufficient to meet the needs of a specific application or use case. By providing an opportunity to perform custom operations during initialization, developers can ensure that their objects are correctly and completely initialized before they are used. It gives opportunity to implement data validation rules.

    It can improve the overall quality and reliability of an application by reducing the likelihood of subtle bugs which may be due to the implicit initial values set up by default constructor.

Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    public Person {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be non-negative.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30); // Valid
Person invalidPerson = new Person("Bob", -5); // Throws IllegalArgumentException
```   
   

3. **Default Constructor:**
   Records have a default constructor that initializes all components to their default values (null or zero).
   
Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}

// Usage
Person person = new Person(); // Components initialized to null and 0
```

4. **Custom Constructor:**
   We can create custom constructors with subset of parameters, allowing flexibility in object creation.
   
Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    public Person {
        if (name == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be null.");
        }
    }

    public Person(int age) {
        this("Unknown", age);
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30); // Valid
Person unknownPerson 
    = new Person(25); // Uses custom constructor with default name "Unknown"
```
In this example, we can create a custom constructor that only takes in the `age` parameter. This means that when we create an instance of the `Person` class, we only need to provide the `age` value. The other properties will be set to their default values.

This feature is especially useful when dealing with large and complex classes that have many properties. It allows developers to create objects quickly and efficiently without having to specify all the properties every time.

### Accessing Components

- Components in a record are implicitly `final`, making them immutable.
- Records automatically generate getters for components, providing read-only access.

```java
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
String name = person.name(); // Getter for 'name'
int age = person.age(); // Getter for 'age'
```

When working with records in Java, it is important to understand how to access their components. Components are the individual fields or properties that make up a record. For example, in the code above, the `Person` record has two components: `name` and `age`. 

To access the components of a record, you first need to create an instance of the record using the `new` keyword. In this case, we are creating a new `Person` record and assigning it to a variable called `person`. The values `Alice` and `30` are passed as arguments to the `Person` constructor, which initializes the `name` and `age` components of the record. 

Once you have an instance of the record, you can access its components using getters. Getters are methods that are automatically generated by the Java compiler for each component of a record. In the code above, we are using the `name()` and `age()` getters to retrieve the values of the `name` and `age` components, respectively. As these are read only properties, there are no setters available for `name` and `age`.


One of the key things to note is that components within a record are implicitly `final`, which means that they are immutable. This can be both a benefit and a drawback, depending on the specific use case. On the one hand, having immutable components can help ensure that the data within a record is consistent and doesn't change unexpectedly. This can be particularly important in situations where the record is being used to store critical information, such as financial data or personal information. On the other hand, having immutable components can make it more difficult to modify or update the data within a record. If you need to change a value within a record, you may need to create a new record entirely rather than simply updating a single component.

Regardless of the pros and cons, it's important to understand how to access the components within a Java record. Fortunately, records automatically generate getters for components, providing read-only access. This can make it easier to retrieve data from a record without worrying about accidentally modifying it.

### Overriding Methods

Records automatically generate methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` based on components. We can customize these methods as needed.

Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Automatically generated methods can be overridden
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("Person{name='%s', age=%d}", name, age);
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
System.out.println(person); // Output: Person{name='Alice', age=30}
```
### Delegating Methods

Record methods can delegate behavior to other methods within the record or external methods. This enables code reuse and modular design.

Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    public Person withName(String name) {
        return new Person(name, age);
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("Alice", 50); // Person[name=Alice, age=50]
Person newPerson = person.withName("Tom"); // Person[name=Tom, age=50]
```
### Implementing Methods

We can add additional methods to records, allowing them to encapsulate behavior related to the data.

Example:
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    public boolean isAdult() {
        return age >= 18;
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
System.out.println(person.isAdult()); // Output: true
```

## Practical Use Cases And Scenarios

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Let's compare a record with a traditional Java class to highlight the reduction in boilerplate code:

```java
// Traditional Java class
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // Manually written equals() method
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        // Manually written hashCode() method
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        // Manually written toString() method
        // ...
    }
}
```

The equivalent Java record achieves the same functionality with significantly less code:

```java
// Java record
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

Java records not only enhance readability and maintainability but also promote a more expressive and concise coding style, allowing us to focus on the core logic of their applications.

Certainly! Let's create the section on creating Java records, focusing on the simplicity of the process and providing examples with different data types and use cases.


### Use Various Data Types

1. **String and Enums:**

   ```java
   public record Student(String name, int age, Grade grade) {
       // Record body
   }

   public enum Grade {
       A, B, C, D, F
   }
   ```

2. **Nested Records:**

   ```java
   public record Address(String city, String state) {
       // Record body
   }

   public record Person(String name, int age, Address address) {
       // Record body
   }
   ```

### Define DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
   Java records are ideal for representing DTOs, encapsulating data for communication between different layers of an application.

   ```java
   public record UserDTO(String username, String email, boolean isActive) {
       // Record body
   }
   ```

### Define Configuration Settings
   Use records to define configurations, promoting clarity and simplicity in managing application settings.

   ```java
   public record AppConfig(String apiUrl, int maxConnections, boolean enableLogging) {
       // Record body
   }
   ```

### Define Immutable Entities
   Records ensure immutability, making them perfect for representing immutable entities in our domain model...

   ```java
   public record UserKey(UUID key, Date activeSince, Date expiry) {
       // Record body
   }
   ```

Creating Java records not only simplifies our code but also enhances readability and maintainability. Embrace the power of records in our Java applications to streamline our data-centric classes and elevate our coding experience.

### Handle Complex Objects

Records maintain immutability even when dealing with complex objects. If a record contains non-primitive or mutable components, ensure that these components are also immutable or use defensive copies to maintain the overall immutability of the record.

```java
public record Address(String city, List<String> streets) {
    // Automatically generated methods ensure immutability, but caution with mutable components
}

List<String> streets = new ArrayList<>();
streets.add("Street 1");
streets.add("Street 2");

Address address = new Address("City", List.copyOf(streets));
streets.add("Street 3");

System.out.println(address.streets()); // Output: [Street 1, Street 2]
```

Let's explore best practices for using Java records effectively in projects, guidelines for maintaining code consistency and readability, and practical applications and conclusions.
