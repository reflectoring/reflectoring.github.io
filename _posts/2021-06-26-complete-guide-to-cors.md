“CORS” stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing that defines the protocol to use between a web browser and a server to determine whether a cross-origin request is allowed. 

In this article, we will understand cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), describe some common examples of cross-origin resource sharing vulnerabilities, and suggest methods to protect against these attacks.

## What is CORS
CORS is a security standard implemented by browsers that enable scripts running in browsers to access resources located outside of the browser's domain. The CORS policy is published under the [Fetch standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org) defined by the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org) community which also publishes many web standards like HTML5, DOM, and URL.

## Why do we need CORS

CORS helps to maintain the integrity of a website and secure it from unauthorized access. Browsers protect their resources by applying a default security policy called the Same-Origin Policy which was defined in the early years of the web.

The Same-Origin Policy however turned out to be too restrictive for the new age applications where we often need to fetch different kinds of resources from multiple origins. 

The CORS standard was defined to relax this restriction. It is implemented by all modern browsers to allow controlled access to resources located outside of the browser's origin. 

To understand CORS, we should first understand Origin along with the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).

## What is Origin

An Origin in the context of CORS consists of three elements:

- URI scheme for example http:// or https://

- Hostname like www.xyz.com

- Port number like 8000 or 80 (default HTTP port)

We consider two URLs to be of the same Origins only if all three elements match.

A more elaborate explanation of - the Web Origin Concept, is available in [RFC 6454](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454).


## Same Origin vs Cross Origin
For understanding CORS, it is important to first understand the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).

The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a default security policy implemented by Browsers, which permits the browser to load resources only from a server hosted in the same origin as the browser. 

In the absence of the Same-Origin Policy, any website will be able to access the document object model (DOM) of other websites and allow it to access potentially sensitive data as well as perform malicious actions on other websites without requiring user consent.

For example, the HTML documents served with URLs: http://www.mydomain.com/mypage.html and http://www.mydomain.com/subpage/mypage1.html have the same origin: the scheme is HTTP, the domain is www.mydomain.com, and the port is 80. We can run JavaScripts in `mypage.html` which will be able to fetch contents from `mypage1.html`.

In contrast, the HTML documents served with URLs:
http://www.mydomain.com/page.html and https://www.mydomain.com/page1.html have different origins due to the mismatch in their schemes (HTTP vs HTTPS). JavaScripts running in `page.html` will be prevented from fetching contents from `page1.html` without a CORS policy configured correctly.


## How Browsers Implement CORS Policy

When a web page sends a request to a server, the browser detects whether the request is to a server from the same origin and determines whether to apply CORS policy. The browser applies the CORS policy, If the web page sending the request is not in the same origin as the browser, then the CORS policy is applied.

The browser does this by exchanging a set of CORS headers with the server. Based on the header values returned from the server, the browser provides access to the server response or blocks the access by throwing a CORS error. 

### Important CORS Headers

When we make a CORS request, the browser sends a header named `Origin` with the request to the server. To serve this cross-origin request, the server sends back a header named `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response. 

The browser checks the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the response and renders the response only if the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is the same as the `Origin` header sent in the request. The server can also use wild cards like `*`  as the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to represent a partial match with the value of the `Origin` header received in the request.

### CORS Failures

CORS failures cause errors but specifics about the error are not available to the browser for security reasons. The only way to know about the error is by looking at the browser's console for details of the error which is usually in the following form:

```shell
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/orders' from origin 'http://localhost:9000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Type of CORS Requests

The browser sends three types of CORS requests: simple, preflight, and requests with credentials. The browser determines the type of request to be sent to the server depending on the kind of operations we want to perform with the server resource. Let us understand these request types and observe these requests in the browsers' network log by running an example.

### Simple CORS Requests (GET, POST, and HEAD)
Simple requests are sent by the browser for server operations it considers safe because they do not change the state of any existing resource on the server. The request sent by the browser is simple if one of the below conditions applies: 

- The HTTP request method is GET, POST, or HEAD
- The HTTP request contains a CORS safe-listed header: Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language, Content-Type.
- When using the Content-Type header, the only values allowed are: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain
- No event listeners are registered on any XMLHttpRequestUpload object
- No ReadableStream object is used in the request

The browser sends the simple request as a normal request similar to the Same Origin request, and the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is checked by the browser when the response is returned.


### Preflight Requests
In contrast to simple requests, the browser sends preflight requests for operations that intend to change the state of existing resources in the server. We use the HTTP methods PUT and DELETE for these operations. 

These requests are not considered safe so the web browser first makes sure that cross-origin communication is allowed by first sending a preflight request before sending the actual request. Requests which do not satisfy the criteria for simple request also fall under this category.

The preflight request is an HTTP `OPTIONS` method which is sent automatically by the browser to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, to check that the server will permit the actual request. Along with the preflight request, the browser sends the following headers:

**Access-Control-Request-Method**: This is a list of HTTP methods of the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
**Access-Control-Request-Headers**: This is a list of headers that will be sent with the request
**Origin**: The origin header that contains the source origin of the request

The actual request to the server will not be sent if the result of the `OPTIONS` method is that the request cannot be made.

After the preflight request is complete, the actual PUT method with CORS headers is sent.

### CORS Requests with Credentials

In most real-life situations, we need to send CORS requests loaded with some kind of access credentials which could be an `Authorization` header or cookies. The default behavior of cross-origin resource requests is for the requests to be passed without any of these credentials. 

If credentials are passed with the request, the browser will not allow access to the response unless the server sends a CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` with a value of `true`.

## Example of Working with CORS
For observing the CORS requests, let us run two web applications written in Node.Js which will communicate with each other by following the CORS standard:
1. A `OrderProcessor` web application containing a REST API with `GET` and `PUT` methods
2. A web application hosting the HTML page which will communicate with the REST APIs in the `OrderProcessor` application.

We can run these applications in our local machine using `npm` and `node`. The application hosting the HTML page is running on `http://localhost:9000`. This makes Ajax calls with the `XMLHttpRequest` to the `OrderProcessor` application running on `http://localhost:8000`. 

These are CORS requests since the HTML page and `OrderProcessor` application is running in different Origins (because of different port numbers: 8000 and 9000 although they use the same scheme: HTTP and host: `localhost`).

### Server Side Handling CORS Requests in Node.Js
We are using a very simple Node.JS application named `OrderProcessor` built with Express as our server. We have created two REST APIs with `GET` and `PUT` methods or fetching updating `orders`. 

This is a snippet of the `GET` method of our `OrderProcessor` application running on `localhost:8000`:

```js
app.get('/orders', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Returning orders');
  res.send(orders);
});

```
The `GET` method defined here is used to return a collection of `orders`.

### Client-Side Sending CORS Requests from Javascript 
For sending requests to the `OrderProcessor` application described in the previous section, we will use an HTML page and package this inside another Node.JS application running on `localhost:9000`.

We will call the `GET` and `PUT` methods from this HTML page using the `XMLHttpRequest` javascript object:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <script>
       function load(domainURL) {
          var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
          xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
              if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
              }
          };
          xhttp.open("GET", domainURL, true);
          xhttp.send();
        }  

        function loadFromCrossOrigin() {
            load("http://localhost:8000/orders")
        } 
  </script>
</head>
<body>            
  <div id="demo">
    <h2>Order Processing</h2>
    <div>
      <button type="button" 
              onclick="loadFromCrossOrigin()">
              ...
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
The HTML shown here contains a button which we need to click to trigger the CORS request from the javascript method `loadFromCrossOrigin`.

### CORS Error Due to Same Origin Policy
If we run these applications without any additional configurations (setting CORS headers) in the server, we will get a CORS error in our browser console as shown below:

![cors failure](/assets/img/posts/cors/cors-fail.png)

This is an error caused by the restriction of accessing cross origins due to the Same Origin Policy.  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/orders' from origin 'http://localhost:9000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

### Fixing the CORS Error For Simple Requests
As suggested in the CORS error description, let us modify the server side code to return the CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response:

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:9000");
  next();
});

app.get('/orders', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Returning orders');
  res.send(orders);
});
```
We are returning a CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with a value of source origin `http://localhost:9000` to fix the CORS error.

The CORS relevant request headers and response headers from a simple request are shown below:

```
Request URL: http://localhost:8000/orders
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 200 OK

**Request Headers**
Host: localhost:8000
Origin: http://localhost:9000

**Response Headers**
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:9000

```
In this example, the HTML served from `http://localhost:9000` sends a cross-origin request to a REST API with the URL `http://localhost:8000/orders`. This is a simple request since it is a `GET` request. We can see an `Origin` header sent in the request with a value of `http://localhost:9000` which is the origin URL of the browser. 

The server responds with a response header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.  The browser is able to render the response only since the response header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` has the value `http://localhost:9000` which exactly matches the value of the `Origin` header sent in the request. We can also configure partial matches by using wild cards in the form of `*` or `http://*localhost:9000`.  


### CORS Handling for Preflight Request
Now we will modify our server side application to handle preflight request for calls made to the `PUT` method which looks like this:

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:9000");
  res.header(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
    "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept"
  );
  res.header(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
    "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE"
  );
  next();
});
app.put('/orders', (req, res) => {
  console.log('updating orders');
  res.send(orders);
});

```

For handling the preflight request, we are returning two more headers:
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers` containing the headers `Origin`, `X-Requested-With`, `Content-Type`, `Accept` the server should accept.
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` containing the HTTP methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` that the browser should send to the server.

When we send the PUT request from our HTML page, we can see two requests in the browser network log:

![cors preflight](/assets/img/posts/cors/preflight.png)

The preflight request with the `OPTIONS` method is followed by the actual request with the `PUT` method.

We can observe the following request and response headers of the preflight request in the browser console:

```
Request URL: http://localhost:8000/orders
Request Method: OPTIONS
Status Code: 200 OK
..
..

Request Headers:
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Connection: keep-alive
Host: localhost:8000
Origin: http://localhost:9000


Response Headers

Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:9000
Allow: GET,HEAD,PUT
```

In this example, the browser served from `http://localhost:9000` sends a PUT request to a REST API with URL: `http://localhost:8000/orders`. Since this is a PUT request which will change the state of an existing resource in the server, the browser sends a preflight request using the HTTP OPTIONS method. In response, the server informs the browser that `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT` methods are allowed.

### CORS Handling for Request with Credentials
We will now send a credential in the form of a `Authorization` header in our CORS request:

```js
function sendAuthRequestToCrossOrigin() {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
        }
    };
    xhr.open('GET', "http://localhost:8000/orders", true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer rtikkjhgffw456tfdd');
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    xhr.send();
}
```
Here we are sending a bearer token as the value of our `Authorization` header. To allow the browser to read the response, the server needs to send the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header in the response:
```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:9000");
  res.header(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
    "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization"
  );
  res.header(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
    "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE"
  );
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials",true);
  next();
});
app.put('/orders', (req, res) => {
  console.log('updating orders');
  res.send(orders);
});

```
We have modified our server-side code to send a value `true` for the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header so that the browser is able to read the response. We have also added the `Authorization` in the list of allowed request headers in the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.

We can see the request and response headers in the browser console:
```shell
Request URL: http://localhost:8000/orders
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 200 OK

Response Headers:

Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:9000

Request Headers:

Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Authorization: Bearer rtikkjhgffw456tfdd

Origin: http://localhost:9000

```
We can see the security credential in the form of the `Authorization` header containing the bearer token in the request and server including the `Authorization` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` list of allowed headers in the request. The browser can access the response since the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header sent by the server is `true`.

## Conclusion
In this article, we learned about CORS and how to use CORS policy to communicate between websites from different origins.

Here is a summary of the topics we covered:

1. CORS is a security standard implemented by browsers which enables us to allow access to resources from a different origin. 
2. CORS requests are of three types: Simple, Preflight, and Request with Credentials.
3. Simple requests are used to perform safe operations like an HTTP GET method.
4. Preflighted requests are for performing operations with side-affects like PUT and DELETE methods.
5. We sent cross-origin requests from an HTML page of one application to APIs in the other application. We then observed the CORS requests in the console log of the browser.

I hope this will help you to get started with fixing CORS errors.
