## Overview

{% include book-link.html book="essentialism" %} shows the way of what the author calls an "Essentialist". Essentialists don't spend time and energy on the non-essentials in their lives, freeing them up to focus on the essentials. 

The book is written in an easy-to-read manner, with short chapters that one can read in a lunch break. The chapters are each titled with a single succinct verb, in essentialist manner.


## Notes

Here are my notes, as usual with some comments in *italics*.

### Trade-Off

* "Saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others."
* an essentialist strategy is based on principled decisions / trade-offs
* act or be acted upon

### Escape

* take time to think through options before committing to the best option
* create a regular space and time free of distractions to do deep work (*like thinking about your options and deciding which to take*)
* "The faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule."

### Look

* filter out the noise in everything, look for signal
* maintain a journal and revisit it from time to time to check that you're still doing your essentials
* ask questions (or the same question again and again) to gain clarity on your direction

### Play

* play fosters creativity and exploration
* relax every once in a while

### Sleep

* "The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves."
* protect your best asset
* enough sleep supports creativity and allows us to make better decisions 

### Select

* having very selective criteria to make decisions makes the decisions easier (either "Hell yeah", or "No!" - also see [the book with this title](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52523856-hell-yeah-or-no?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=fnAoAkCpGz&rank=1) by Derek Sivers)
* give options a rating between 0 and 100 - everything below 90 is out
* make your criteria explicit to make decisions almost automatic - write the criteria down
* ask yourself:
  * "what am I passionate about?"
  * "what taps my talent?"
  * "what meets a significant need in the world?"

### Clarify

* when deciding, ask yourself "If I didn't have this opportunity, what would I be willing to do to acquire it?" (we often value what we already have more than what we don't have, so this question might reduce this bias)
* people thrive when they have a high level of clarity on goals and roles
* find your essential intents to guide your decisions
* essential intents are inspirational, concrete, meaningful, and measurable 

### Dare

* when you feel tension between what you feel is right and what someone expects of you, say "no"
* "Courage is the key to the process of elimination."
* separate saying "no" to someone from the relationship to that person
* think about what you're giving up when you say "yes"
* a "no" gains respect in the long run
* be slow with a "yes" and be quick with a "no"

### Uncommit

* uncommit from unfruitful projects - don't fall for the sunk-cost bias
* the endowment effect makes it hard for us to let go of things - pretend you don't know the things you're attached to
* admit to failure to let go of projects
* pause before answering a request
* do a "reverse pilot" to get rid of commitments - try some time without doing it and see what happens (most of the times nothing bad happens and we can let go of the commitment) 

### Edit

* editing is the process of removing things to make something better
* edit the non-essential things out of your work and life, even if you've put considerable effort into them
* make editing a habit to regularly correct your path (*a great way of doing this is having a weekly distraction-free "rendezvous with yourself" and reviewing all the areas of your life for non-essential commitments*)

### Limit

* clear boundaries empower us to concentrate on our goals instead of other people's goals
* articulate your boundaries to make them clear to yourself
* write down each time you feel a boundary has been crossed to make boundary violations visible
* clarify your boundaries with colleagues before starting a project together

### Buffer

* things inevitably take longer than expected - build in a buffer
* start working on something at the earliest possible moment, not the latest, even if it's just a few minutes of thinking
* add 50% to all estimations (*we should make this a hard rule in software estimations!*)

### Subtract

* invest time in removing obstacles just as you're investing time in essential tasks
* remove the "slowest hiker" first (i.e. help the slowest person in a hiking group to make the whole group faster) - what's the obstacle that slows you down most?

### Progress

* create small goals to make execution almost effortless
* celebrate small wins
* "Of all forms of human motivation, the most effective is progress."
* start small and build momentum (*this is also good advice for starting a bootstrapped business*)
* follow the "minimum viable progress" - what's the minimum step towards a goal?
* start "early and small" instead of "late and big"
* "Just a few seconds of preparation pay a valuable dividend."
* visually reward progress (*the easiest way is to check off a todo list, but you can be more creative about it*)

### Flow

* don't "push through" - instead, design a routine that makes execution almost effortless
* "Routine is one of the most powerful tools for removing obstacles."
* connect existing cues to new routines (*also see my book notes for ["The Power of Habit"](/book-review-the-power-of-habit/)*)
* do the hardest thing first
* if you're working on multiple projects, have a theme for each day so your focus for the day is clear

### Focus

* don't let your mind wander to past failures and successes or future challenges and opportunities - stay in the "now" to focus
* write down ideas to "get the future out of your head"
* take note of moments when you are fully present in the moment and try to re-create them

### Be

* clear out the "wardrobe of your life" to gain clarity (wardrobes are notoriously full of things we no longer need)
* pause, push back, stop rushing, take control
* live the moment
* whenever faced with a decision, ask yourself "what is essential?"

## Conclusion

The book is definitely worth a read, giving inspiration to re-think your decisions and plan your future decisions. I'll be asking myself more often what really is essential in my life and what isn't.
