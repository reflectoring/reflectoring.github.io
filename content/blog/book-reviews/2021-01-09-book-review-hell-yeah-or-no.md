## Overview

{% include book-link.html book="hell-yeah" %} is a very succinctly written book about some lessons the author made in his life and thought worth sharing.

It's a collection of very short chapters of 1-5 pages. Each chapter was once a blog post that contains one lesson about life. It's basically a window into the philosophy of Derek Sivers, a maker and entrepreneur.

It's about things like finding your identity, making things happen, saying yes and no, and finding out what's worth doing.

## Notes

Here are my notes, as usual with some comments in *italics*.

### Updating Identity

* what's left if you stopped doing everything you did for money and attention? (*i.e. don't let your work life define you*)
* your actions reveal your values
  * your small actions make up who you are and thus may change who you are
  * "How you do anything is how you do everything." 
  * your character predicts your future
* if you think you want something but haven't started yet, either 
  * stop lying to yourself that you want it, or 
  * start doing it to see if you really want it
* "Success comes from doing, not declaring."
* if you don't keep doing the same job, you shouldn't keep the same job title - we shouldn't pretend to be something we aren't anymore
* make sure to know what you value most so you can align your decisions with your goals and values
  * always be able to answer why you're doing things
  * but: "Old opinions shouldn't define who you are in the future."
* no matter what your preferences are, someone will always say you're wrong - knowing your preferences will help you handle that
* ideas need not be 100% original - you can copy others and still provide value to the world
* your public persona doesn't need to be yourself - that's inviting stress
* we often don't understand other people because we're biased in our own little bubble of the world - we should try seeing things from their perspective
  * *This is also emphasized in the first chapter of "The Psychology of Money": everybody has a different background, a different history, has grown up with different values and different opportunities, so we shouldn't expect everyone to share our opinions.*
  * a rarely recognized axis of difference between people is being future-focused vs. being present-focused - try to use this to understand other people

## Saying No

* if you don't feel like "Hell yeah!" about an opportunity, don't do it - it will free you up for the next "Hell yeah!" thing
* create an environment that makes it easy to say "no" to distractions (*hide your phone while working on something, close the door, close your browser tabs, ... see [my notes on "Make Time"](/book-review-make-time/) for some more*)
* we focus so much on being useful that we have forgotten to do things for ourselves
* it's ok to be a "slow thinker" - manage other people's expectations to not expect immediate answers to their questions (*I definitely fall into the category of slow thinkers - there's little I hate more than people expecting immediate answers from me, I always need to think things through first*)
* motivation is delicate and can be influenced by subtle tweaks - find the tweaks that improve your motivation, even if it's a bit inconvenient to other people
* if you get too comfortable, it may be time to let go of something you love doing to gain freedom for change
* before you start something new, think about the ways it might end - maybe it's better to say no
* "Empty time has the potential to be filled with great things. Time filled with little things has little potential." (*This is something I've been trying to teach my kids - being bored for a while is a great opportunity, not a great loss*)
* when you're feeling down, raise your bar and say no to everything that doesn't help you feel better

## Making Things Happen

* there's no speed limit on learning or creating something - the only limiting factor is yourself
* instead of going full-on 100%, dial back to 50% and compare your results to earlier - they may be almost the same as if you went 100% and you just gained time for other stuff!
* disconnecting from the internet and from people gives room for doing one's best work
* when feeling unmotivated do some of those boring but necessary chores to get back into doing something
* compare to the next thing below your situation, not the next thing above your situation - you'll feel gratitude for what you have instead of envy for what you don't have
* "Great insight comes only from opening your mind to many options" - there are usually more than two options - make a list
* "Asking advice should be like echolocation" - bounce ideas off people to get the whole picture
  * don't trust a single source of advice
* first, try many different things, then, when you've found something rewarding, focus on that, and it will probably pay out
* "Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years" - think long term, you have a lot of time (hopefully)

## Changing Perspective

* assume you're below average and you'll be free to learn and ask questions (*I think this is a good way to get into a [Growth Mindset](/book-review-mindset/)*)
* don't think that everything is someone else's false - instead, assume that it's your fault and you have the power to change it! (*this is a core tenet in ["The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"](/book-review-7-habits/) - change yourself instead of trying to change others*)
* "Amazingly rare things happen to people every day" - thinking about this will change your perspective

## What's Worth Doing?

* "Everybody's ideas seem obvious to them" - but they're often amazing to others
* if it makes you happy *and* it's smart for your long-term future *and* it's useful to others, it's worth doing - drop one of the three attributes and it might not be worth doing
* "If you have too much stability, you get bored. If you don't have enough stability, you panic." 
* "Do something for love and something for money" - don't mix them - the two halves will balance each other out
* ask "what do I hate not doing?" instead of "what do I love doing?" to get a new perspective
* "Learning without doing is wasted" (*yes! Also see my notes on ["Pragmatic Thinking & Learning"](/book-review-pragmatic-thinking/)*)
* make decisions as late as possible to because you'll have the most information
* don't start a business until people are asking you to - prove a real demand first

## Fixing Faulty Thinking

* "We don't get wise just by adding and adding. We also need to subtract." - unlearn things that don't work (anymore) (*that's why I unlearned JavaScript, but it came back!*)
* read books and apply the general lessons to your life - don't get hung up on examples in the books that most likely have nothing to do with your life
* "To make a change, you have to be extreme." - to change habits, do an extreme to have a better chance at changing it

## Saying Yes

* some people are born with talent, but you can also become talented with long years of practice
* "Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment." - a great goal makes you take action immediately
* "Inspiration is not receiving information. Inspiration is applying what you've received."
* "You grow by doing what excites you and scares you."
* whatever scares you, go do it - you won't be scared by it for long

## Conclusion

The book is full of very small chapters that encouraged me to think about my decisions and how I'm spending my time. Most chapters tell a story from the author's life, so they're not directly applicable to our own lives, but they're still very inspirational. 

The book has a high density of inspirational quotes - I'm still thinking about how to make the most of them. And it's a quick read. In summary, I strongly recommend reading this book.
