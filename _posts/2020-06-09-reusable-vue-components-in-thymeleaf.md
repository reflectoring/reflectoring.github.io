In the good old days, we implemented web applications with a server-side web framework. The browser sends a request to the server, the server processes the request and answers with HTML, the browser renders that HTML.

Nowadays, every application frontend seems to be a single page application (SPA) that loads a bunch of Javascript at the start and then uses Javascript-based templating to render the frontend.

What if we combine the two? This article shows a way of combining Vue.js components with a Thymeleaf-based server-side web application. 

**I'm using this method in [blogtrack.io](https://blogtrack.io), a blog tracking service going into beta soon**, and I'm very happy with it.

## The Problems of SPAs

While SPAs allow for building more interactive, desktop-like applications, they also introduce new problems: 

* we need a mechanism to load only the Javascript resources we need on a certain page,
* we might need to render part of the page on the server so that the user doesn't see a blank page (time to first content),
* we have to handle page refreshs and the back-button,
* we have to handle analytics ourselves because analytics providers usually only count when a page is loaded,
* ... and a whole bunch of other problems I don't pretend to understand.

Solutions to many of these problems exist, but they add new problems (like the "time to interactive" metric) and complexity to the SPA frameworks, making them harder to use and understand. This leads to [SPA fatigue](https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html).

**But building applications with only old-school server-side web frameworks is not a solution, either.** We want modern, interactive frontends, for which we need Javascript. 

So, what if we use a server-side web framework to render HTML that includes some Javascript components here and there, to add this interactivity?  

## Reusable Javascript Components

The goal is to create narrowly scoped, potentially re-usable Javascript components that we can place into the HTML rendered by our server-side web framework using `<script>` tags. 

However, we don't want to simply hack some untested Javascript that adds some JQuery here and there (it's not the 90s anymore!) but take advantage of the rich feature set that today's SPA frameworks bring to the table. 

We want:

* to preview the Javascript components without starting the server-side application,
* to write and run tests for these Javascript components,
* to include selected Javascript components in a server-rendered HTML page without loading all of them, 
* to minify the Javascript, and 
* to integrate the build of the Javascript components with the build of the server-side application.

Let's see how we can achieve this **by using client-side Vue.js components in HTML pages generated with the server-side templating engine Thymeleaf**.

## The Sample Project

For this article, imagine we're building a dashboard application that displays some charts. We want to integrate the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library to create those charts. But instead of just adding hand-rolled, untested Javascript to our server-side HTML templates, we want to wrap those charts in components built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

**We're using server-generated HTML to render the layout and all the static and dynamic content that doesn't require Javascript and only use Vue.js components for the interactive Javascript components**.

In our project directory, we create a folder for the server-side Spring Boot application and another for the client-side Javascript components:

```
thymeleaf-vue
├── server
└── client
```

Let's fill these folders with live!

### Setting up the Server-Side Web Application with Spring Boot & Thymeleaf

We start by building a Spring Boot application that serves a page generated with the Thymeleaf templating engine.

We can let [Spring Boot Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.3.0.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=io.reflectoring&artifactId=thymeleaf-vue&name=thymeleaf-vue&description=Combining%20Thymeleaf%20and%20Vue.js&packageName=io.reflectoring.thymeleaf-vue&dependencies=thymeleaf,web) generate a ZIP file for us and extract the contents into the `server` folder (actually, we need to move the Gradle files back into the main folder - see the [example project on Github](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/thymeleaf-vue) for the final folder structure.

Next, we create the page template `src/main/resources/templates/hello-vue.html`:

```html
<html>
  <body>
  <h1 th:text="${title}">This title will be replaced</h1>
  <p> Here comes a Vue component!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is just a simple "Hello World"-style page that displays a title that is defined by the backend. We're going to add a Vue.js component to it later.

Also, we add a controller that serves this page:

```java
@Controller
class HelloVueController {

  @GetMapping("/")
  ModelAndView showHelloPage() {
  Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<>();
  model.put("title", "Hello Vue!");
  return new ModelAndView("hello-vue.html", model);
  }

}
```

If we start the application with `./gradlew bootrun` and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), we should see this page:

![hello vue](/assets/img/posts/reusable-vue-components-in-thymeleaf/hello-vue.png)

**We now have a working server-side web application driven by a Thymeleaf template**. Time to create some Javascript components.

### Building a Javascript Chart Component with Vue.js

For the client-side Javascript components, we'll use Vue.js, which is a framework we can use to create SPAs, but which **specifically supports exporting components to be consumed outside of a SPA**.

We'll need Node.js installed on our machine to support the Vue development environment. 

When Node is installed, we can install the Vue CLI:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

This brings us the `vue` command, which we use to create our Vue project. From the parent folder of our project (`thymeleaf-vue`), we run

```
vue create client
```

to create the `client` subfolder and fill it with a default Vue application. We end up with a file structure like this:

```
thymeleaf-vue
├── server
└── client
  ├── src
  |   ├── assets
  |   └── components
  └── package.json
```

I omitted some files for clarity.

Now, we want to create a Vue component that displays a chart. Let's say **the chart shall take 7 numbers as input, one for each day in the week, and display them in a bar chart**.

Note that the chart is just an example. We can create any simple or complex client-side Javascript component with our without Vue.js and use it in a server-side template.

First, we add the dependency to chart.js to our `package.json` file:

```
npm install --save chart.js
```

Next, we create our `WeekChart` component as a [single file component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html):

```vue 
<template>
  <div class="chart-container">
  <canvas ref="chart"></canvas>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Chart from "chart.js";

export default {
  name: "WeekChart",

  props: {
    chartData: {
      type: Array,
      required: true,
    },
  },

  mounted: function() {
    const config = {
      type: "bar",
      data: {
        labels: [
          "Monday", 
          "Tuesday", 
          "Wednesday",
          "Thursday",
          "Friday",
          "Saturday",
          "Sunday"],
        datasets: [
          {
          data: this.chartData
          },
        ]
      },
  };

  new Chart(this.$refs.chart, config);
  }
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.chart-container {
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
```

This component bundles the HTML markup, some Javascript, and some CSS into a self-sufficient UI component. Note that we're importing the `Chart` object from the `chart.js` library. The component has a single input parameter (or "prop" in JS lingo) called `chartData`, which takes an array of values - one value for each day of the week. 

Within the `mounted` function, we're creating a chart configuration according to the [chart.js docs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/), pass the `chartData` input parameter into this config, and finally bind this config to the `<canvas>` element in the template section via the `ref=chart` attribute.

In `package.json`, we change the `build` script so that **it builds our component as a library instead of a SPA**:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "vue-cli-service build --target lib --dest dist/WeekChart --name WeekChart src/components/WeekChart.vue",
  },
  ...
}
```

If we run `npm run build` now, the Vue CLI will create several different versions of our `WeekChart` component in the `dist` folder. The one we're interested in is `WeekChart.umd.min.js`, which is a self-sufficient Javascript file containing all dependencies (except for Vue itself) that we can include in any HTML page.

### Previewing the Vue Component with Storybook

Now that we've built a chart component, we want to see if it works without having to embed it into our application. For this, we'll use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

[Integrating Storybook with Vue](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-vue/) is surprisingly simple, we merely have to execute this command in our `client` folder:

```
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type vue
``` 

This adds a `storybook` script and all required dependencies to our `package.json` and creates a folder `stories`, which now contains some sample "stories". 

We'll add a story to the storybook by creating the file `stories/WeekChart.stories.js` with this content:

```javascript
import WeekChart from '../src/components/WeekChart.vue';

export default {
  title: 'WeekChart',
  component: WeekChart,
};

export const DefaultState = () => ({
  components: { 
  chart: WeekChart
  },
  template: `<chart v-bind:chartData="[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]" />`
});
```

This file creates an instance of our `WeekChart` component with the name `DefaultState` and exports it so that Storybook can pick it up and include it in its GUI. 

Running `npm run storybook` will start a local web server and serve the stories in a nice UI when we open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) in a browser:

![Storybook](/assets/img/posts/reusable-vue-components-in-thymeleaf/storybook.png)

We know that our bar chart component is working now. Storybook is nice to use during development to make sure that our changes have the desired effect. **But if we do a refactoring to any of our components and forget to check it in Storybook, we may still break our components**. So, let's add an automated test that runs during the build.

### Adding a Unit Test for the Vue Component

We want to create tests for each of our Vue components that run during the CI build to make sure that errors in a component will break the build. For this, we rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a popular Javascript testing framework that integrates well with Vue.js.

To set up Jest in our project, we add the following entries to our `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test": "vue-cli-service test:unit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
    "@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest": "^4.4.0",
    "@vue/test-utils": "^1.0.3"
  }
}
```

This adds the dependencies needed to work with Jest in Vue, and it adds a script to execute the tests. Don't forget to run `npm install` after modifying the dependencies in `package.json`.

Also, we create the file `jest.config.js` to configure Jest to work with `*.vue` files:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: "@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest",
  collectCoverage: true,
  collectCoverageFrom: ["src/**/*.{js,vue}", "!**/node_modules/**"],
  coverageReporters: ["html", "text-summary"]
};
``` 

Next, we create a test for our `WeekChart` component in `src/tests/unit/WeekChart.spec.js`:

```javascript
import { shallowMount } from "@vue/test-utils";
import WeekChart from "../../components/WeekChart.vue";

describe("WeekChart", () => {
  it("renders without error", () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(WeekChart, {
      propsData: {
      chartData: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
      },
    });
  
    const chart = wrapper.findComponent({ name: "WeekChart" });
    expect(chart.exists()).toBe(true);
  });

});
```

We can run the test with `npm run test`.

The test will pass, but it will show some error output on the console:

```
Error: Not implemented: HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext 
  (without installing the canvas npm package)
```

This is because our chart component relies on a canvas element, which is not supported in the Jest runtime environment. **But we want the test to fail in this case!** So, we configure the Jest runtime to throw an error when it encounters this error log. For this, we create the file `jest/console-error-to-exception.setup.js`:

```javascript
import { format } from "util";

beforeEach(() => {
  const { error } = global.console;

  global.console.error = (...args) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i += 1) {
      const arg = args[i];
    
      // add patterns here that should fail a test
      if (typeof arg === "string" &&
           (arg.includes("Vue warn") || arg.includes("Not implemented"))) {
        throw new Error(format(...args));
      }
    }
    error(...args);
  };
});
```

This will intercept calls to `console.error()` and re-throw them as an error if they match a certain pattern. The patterns include the "not implemented" error we encountered before and Vue warnings. 

We now need to tell Jest to run this code before every test by adding the file to `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  setupFilesAfterEnv: [
    "./jest/console-error-to-exception.setup.js"
  ]
};
``` 

**If we run the test again, it will now fail with the same error message as above**. Here's the [source where I got this idea](https://medium.com/@chris.washington_60485/vue-jest-properly-catch-unhandledpromiserejectionwarning-and-vue-warn-errors-in-jest-unit-tests-fcc45269146b).

To fix the underlying problem of the unavailable canvas element, we add a mock canvas to our development dependencies in `package.json`:

```
npm install --save-dev jest-canvas-mock
```

Also, we add another Jest setup file in `/jest/mock-canvas.setup.js` with a single import statement:

```javascript
import 'jest-canvas-mock';
``` 

and add this file to `jest.config.js` to be executed for all tests:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  setupFilesAfterEnv: [
    ...
    "./jest/mock-canvas.setup.js"
 ]
};
```

Now, the tests will have access to a mock Canvas element and the test will be green. 

**The test will now tell us when we broke something.**

### Integrating the Vue Build into the Spring Boot Build

We have a Spring Boot application that's being built with a Gradle process (you can probably also do it with Maven, but I'm a Gradle fanboy) and a Vue component that is built with NPM. **We want to include our Vue component in the Spring Boot application so it can serve the Javascript together with the HTML.** How do we do that?

The solution I went for is to wrap the Javascript build within Gradle. When the Gradle build starts, it triggers the NPM build, creating ready-for-use Javascript files that we can include in our HTML pages. All we need to do then is to copy those Javascript files to a location where they will be picked up when the Spring Boot application is packaged.

The first step is to make our `client` folder a module in the Gradle build. For this, we create a file `build.gradle` in this folder:

```groovy
plugins {
  id "com.github.node-gradle.node" version "2.2.4"
}

apply plugin: 'java'

task npmBuild(type: NpmTask) {
	inputs.dir("src")
	outputs.dir("dist")
	args = ['run', 'build']
}

task npmClean(type: NpmTask) {
	args = ['run', 'clean']
}

jar {
	into '/static', {
		from 'dist'
		include '**/*.umd.min.js'
	}
}

jar.dependsOn('npmBuild')
clean.dependsOn('npmClean')
``` 

We include the [Gradle Node Plugin](https://github.com/node-gradle/gradle-node-plugin) which enables us to call NPM tasks from within our Gradle build. 

We also apply the Java plugin, which allows us to create a JAR file as an output of the build.

We create the tasks `npmBuild` and `npmClean` which call `npm run build` and `npm run clean`, respectively. 

Then, we configure the `jar` task so that the resulting JAR file will contain a folder `static` with all files from the `dist` folder. Finally, with `dependsOn`, we configure that the `npmBuild` task will run before the `jar` task, because the `npmBuild` task will create the files that the `jar` task needs.

The `static` folder has a special meaning in Thymeleaf: it's content will be served by the web server, so that it can be accessed from the browser. This is important in our case, since we want the browser to load the Javascript files with our Vue components.

Since with the `server` and the `client` folders we now have a multi-module Gradle build, we need to create a `settings.gradle` file in the parent directory that lists all the modules: 

```groovy
rootProject.name = 'thymeleaf-vue'

include 'client'
include 'server'
```

And finally, in the `build.gradle` file of the `server` module, we need to add the dependency to the `client` project:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation project(':client')
  ...
}
```

### Using the Vue Component in a Thymeleaf Template

**If we build the project now with `./gradlew build`, we get a Spring Boot application that carries the file `WeekChart.umd.min.js` in its belly.** That means we can use it in our Thymeleaf template `hello-vue.html` that we have created at the start of this article:

```html
<html>
  <body>
  <h1 th:text="${title}">This title will be replaced</h1>
  <p> Here comes a Vue component!</p>
  
  <div id="chart">
    <chart th:v-bind:chart-data="${chartData}"></chart>
  </div>
  
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
  <script th:src="@{/WeekChart/WeekChart.umd.min.js}"></script>
  <script>
    (function() {
      new Vue({
        components: {
          chart: WeekChart
        }
      }).$mount('#chart')
    })();
  </script>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

We've added a `<div>` with the id `chart` that contains an instance of our `WeekChart` component. 

**We want to provide the data to the chart from the server**, so we add a `th:` (for "thymeleaf") in front of the attribute `v-bind:chart-data` that is expected by vue to pass an array prop into the component. This will let Thymeleaf know that we want this attribute populated with the value of the `chartData` variable.

Also, we added `<script>` tags to load Vue.js and our chart component (which will be served from out of the JAR file of the `client` module). And another `<script>` tag to instantiate the Vue component and bind it to the `<chart>` tag within the `chart` div. 

Finally, we need to modify our server-side controller so that it populates the `chartData` variable:

```java
@Controller
class HelloVueController {

  @GetMapping("/")
  ModelAndView showHelloPage() {
    Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<>();
    model.put("title", "Hello Vue!");
    model.put("chartData", Arrays.asList(7,6,5,4,3,2,1));
    return new ModelAndView("hello-vue.html", model);
  }

}
```

Running `./gradlew bootrun` and opening [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in a browser will now proudly show our Vue chart component on the page, populated with data from the server.

## Conclusion

We have created a Spring Boot application with the server-side template engine Thymeleaf and a Javascript component library that provides a Javascript component built with NPM and Vue. **The result is a hybrid application that allows the server-side template engine to create static HTML pages while including Javascript components that allow more interactivity**.

We have established a proper development environment for both, the server-side Java part, and the client-side Javascript part.

There's certainly more tweaking necessary to get this integration of Vue.js and Thymeleaf customized to a specific project (sharing CSS between client and server, bundling Javascript components together or not, ...) but this article has laid the foundation. 

I'm using this method in my service at [blogtrack.io](https://blogtrack.io) and might report about its evolution in the future. 

A working example including all the bits and pieces that this article glossed over is available [on Github](https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/thymeleaf-vue).
