For the [coderadar](https://github.com/reflectoring/coderadar) project, I'm currently
searching for a way to create a persistent model of a git commit history that contains
the relationships between all commits and the files that were touched within these commits.
And since coderadar is a code quality server, the model should also be able to 
express the history of (code quality) metrics on all files throughout all commits.

My first reflex was to model this with JPA entities in a relational database and
build some really complex HQL queries to access the data. Turns out it works, but the 
relational schema required me to create a join table between the table representing 
commits and the table representing the files that were touched within the commits. 
For each commit, this table contained one entry for each file that exists at the time
of the commit, even if the file was not modified within the commit, so that I could
run queries on it! A test with a git repository containing about 7 500 files and a 
couple thousand commits resulted in 70 million entries in that join table! There has
to be a different solution that does not waste millions of bytes in join tables. Hence,
I had a look at Neo4j.

## Why Neo4j?
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) is a graph database. A graph allows modelling of entities (nodes) and their
relationships to each other. A git commit history is also a graph of commits with
parent/child relationships. Throw in relationships between files and commits and 
relationships between files and code quality metrics and we have the model I'm looking for.

Also, Neo4j has pretty good support with [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/),
which is used in the coderadar project. In addition, the learning curve is not as steep as 
I initially thought, having only worked with relational databases before. The 
[Getting Started Guide](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/) is quite helpful 
and I was able to learn the basics of Neo4j within just one afternoon.
 
## The Graph 
It turns out that I found modelling a graph database is much more fun than modelling a 
relational database, since you just draw nodes and edges and you have a model which
can then be easily transferred into code using [Spring Data Neo4j](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/)
and Neo4j's [Object Graph Mapper](https://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/current/reference/) (OGM).
The following Graph shows the model I came up with after some drawing with pen & paper.

### Commit
A commit node represents a commit in a git history. Every commit is a CHILD OF one or more
other commits (except the first commit, which has no parent) and TOUCHES one or more files
and file snapshots. A commit has a `timestamp` and a `sha1`-hash which serves as identifier.

### File
A file node represents a file during all of its life within the git repository. A file comes into existence when
it is ADDED in a commit and can be MODIFIED or RENAMED over several following commits and finally it
can be DELETED in a final commit. Thus, each file node is connected to one or more commit nodes
via a relationship that specified the type of change the file experienced within that commit. If
a file is not modified within a certain commit, there will be no relationship between the two
nodes.

The other way around, a commit TOUCHES certain files. This relationship is optional from a model
point of view, since we already have the relationship in the other direction. However, bi-directional
relationships make working with the Object Graph Mapper easier in some cases. For example, if you want to store
a node, OGM automatically also stores the nodes that are connected to that node by outgoing relationships.
I can now simply store a Commit node and all TOUCHED file nodes will be saved, too, all within
a single call to the database.

A file node has a single `fileId` as attribute, which just serves as an identifier for the file.

### FileSnapshot
While a file node represents a file all over it's lifetime, a file snapshot node represents a file
at the point in time of a certain commit only. This is necessary, since a file can be renamed 
during it's lifetime, and we need some way to identify a file by it's name. So, a file snaphot
node has a `path` attribute that contains the file's path at the point in time of a certain commit.

### Metric
A metric node represents a certain code quality metric (like cyclomatic complexity). 
It has a `metricId` attribute which serves as identifier for the metrics. A metric node can have
relationships with multiple file snapshot nodes, which represent that the file snapshot has
been MEASURED with this metric. This relationship has the attribute `value` which specified
the value of the metric in the file snapshot.

## Querying the Graph 
So, what's the big thing? Couldn't we have done the same with a relational database. Admittedly,
you can model database tables very similar to the graph in the image above. However, note that 
we only have to to connect commit nodes with files and file snapshots of files that were touched in that commit and not with
ALL files that exist at the time of the commit, thus saving a quadratic amount of storage
space.

Also, querying the
graph is much easier with Neo4j's query language [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/)
than it is with SQL (or HQL for that matter). 
Take this query, which recursively loads all files that were TOUCHED in any commit
previous to a specified commit but have not yet been DELETED.

```text
MATCH 
  (child:Commit {name:<COMMIT_NAME>})-[:IS_CHILD_OF*]->(parent:Commit),
  (parent)-[:TOUCHED]->(file:File)
WHERE NOT 
  ((file)-[:DELETED_IN_COMMIT]->())
RETURN 
  file
```

Try to find an equivalent in SQL for this query that does not rely on having a fully filled
join table between commits and files! I guess you could create such a query if the database
supports hierarchical queries, but those queries would be much harder to create and much less
readable.

## Wrap-Up
My first experience with Neo4j has been quite refreshing. Knowing a lot about JPA and relational
databases I had to open up to the graph concept but I was quickly convinced of the 
expressive nature of a graph database and the elegance in which I could create and query a 
graph database for my use case.

I'm going to continue building a graph database for coderadar to evaluate performance and
maintainability and may report the current state again in a later post. If you want to
have a first-hand look at code, you may want to look at the 
[coderadar-graph](https://github.com/reflectoring/coderadar/tree/master/coderadar-server/coderadar-graph)
module of coderadar. It contains some unit tests that show how to work with Spring Data together with Neo4j.
