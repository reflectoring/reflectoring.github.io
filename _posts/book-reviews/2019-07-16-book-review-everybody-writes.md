## TL;DR: Read this Book, when...

- you want to become a better writer (especially, but not exclusively, in online marketing)
- you want to learn some tricks on how to keep writing
- you want to learn a little about the rules of reporting and publishing

{% include amazon-disclaimer.html %}

## Overview

basic writing tips, later focused on marketing writing

tips on process and habit, not only on grammar and punctuation

not so much about everybody writes as it sounds, more for bloggers and marketers

## Likes & Dislikes

language is very conversational, easy read

very short chapters, each with a very focused tip on writing

author uses words like "discombobulated" and Frankenword", which breaks one of her rules (but then, one of her rules is to break a rule here and then to stay interesting, so she's not contradicting herself)

at the end a little too much focused on marketing for my taste



## Key Takeaways

### How to Write Better

- the quality of content can be measured by the formula `quality = utility x inspiration x empathy`: it's zero if any of the components is zero
- writing is a habit, not an art: write every day to improve 
- don't just punch emails into the keyboard: use them as writing practice
- write when you're freshest to get the most out of it
- there is no single formula for structuring content like "intro / body / conclusion": that would be boring to write and read
- be clear, be brief, and focus on the reader
- start sentences with the important
- re-frame your idea of the text to view it from the reader's perspective to keep the focus on the reader
- "think before ink": have an idea of the why and the what before starting to write
- find a workflow to organize your thoughts into an outline and make it a habit
- produce an "ugly first draft" without caring about spelling or grammar and then rewrite it to be more productive
- "relentlessly, unremittingly, obstinately focus on the reader": best done when taking the reader's place while rewriting or editing
- humor comes with the rewrite, not with the draft
- replace "I" and "we" with "you" to get the reader's interest
- during a rewrite, first focus on paragraphs and then on single words (for trimming a hedge, you'll first use a chainsaw and then a more precise pair of shears)
- start a page with "Dear XXX" (and delete it later) to create a more conversational writing voice, where "XXX" is a persona of your readers
- the first one or two paragraphs in a draft a usually superfluous: delete them or rewrite them ruthlessly
- make sure that modifiers like "only" clearly modify only the part of a sentence you want them to
- make the lead (first paragraphs) and the kicker (last paragraphs) of a text extra good: a good lead makes the reader want more and a good kicker makes the reader sad that it's over
- tell specific stories instead of generic ones: tell a story about 40 year-old Mr. Smith instead of "a middle-aged man"
- use analogies instead of simple adjectives to pique interest
- writing should always make things clearer and aim to make sense of the world, not only in how-tos
- make things simple but don't assume the reader is dumb
- find someone to write / review with to help make it a habit
- don't write by committee or nothing will get done
- a good editor (a human, not a computer program) drastically improves quality
- make readability a primary concern: use checks like the Flesch readability test
- leave something unfinished at the end of a writing session to take momentum into the next session
- set a daily word goal, not a time goal (start with something easily achievable and work upwards)
- set a deadline and don't let yourself push it
