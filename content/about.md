Hi, 

I'm Tom, and I run the reflectoring blog.

I'm a software developer, consultant, architect, coach ... whatever the role, I'm
focused on making things simple.

> The mission of this blog is to provide **comprehensive** and **easy-to-read** learning experiences that generate **"aha" moments** when you need to solve a **specific problem**.

With this blog, my team of authors and I produce:

* deep-dive tutorials about [Spring Boot](/categories/spring-boot)
* hands-on tutorials about [Java](/categories/java)
* opinion pieces on practices of the [Software Craft](/categories/craft)
* some [book reviews](/categories/book-reviews) of the (non-fiction) books I've read.
* ... and more.

If you're interested in working with me or have any feedback about my writing, don't hesitate to contact me.
