[Spring Shell](https://spring.io/projects/spring-shell) allows us to build a command line (shell) application using the Spring framework and all the advantages it provides.

{{% github "https://github.com/thombergs/code-examples/tree/master/spring-boot/spring-shell" %}}

## What Is a Shell Anyways?
A shell provides us with an interface to a system (usually an operating system) to which we give commands and parameters. The shell in turn does some useful tasks for us and provides an output.

## Creating a Basic Shell
First, we have to get the [SpringShell dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.shell/spring-shell-starter) from Maven central, which has everything we need.

In Gradle, the dependency will look something like this:

```groovy
dependencies {  
  implementation 'org.springframework.shell:spring-shell-starter:2.0.1.RELEASE'  
}  
```

Then, since it's a Spring Boot application, our main method has to be annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`
```java  
@SpringBootApplication 
public class SpringShellApplication 
{    
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {    
      SpringApplication.run(SpringShellApplication.class, args);    
	} 
}  
```  

Now, let's create our first shell command which simulates an SSH command:
```java  
@ShellComponent 
public class SSHCommand 
{    
    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(SSHCommand.class.getName());    
    
    @ShellMethod(value = "connect to remote server")    
    public void ssh(@ShellOption(value = "-s") String remoteServer)    
    {    
        log.info(format("Logged to machine '%s'", remoteServer));    
	} 
}  
```  

The annotation `@ShellComponent` tells Spring Shell that an annotated class may contain shell methods, which are annotated with `@ShellMethod`.

As for the `@ShellMethod` annotation, it's used to mark a method as invokable via Spring Shell. We can also see the `value` property which is used to describe the command.

The `@ShellOption` annotation simply states that this command takes a parameter named `-s`.

So as a result when we run the application we get a shell that has a command called `ssh` which takes a parameter `-s` and all it does is logging the passed parameter value to the command line.

```bash  
shell:>ssh -s my-machine  
2022-02-11 15:44:04.065  INFO 5648 --- [           main] j.t.springshell.command.SSHCommand       : Logged to machine 'my-machine'shell:>  
```  

### Modifying the Command Name
The default naming convention for Spring Shell, as we've seen, is taking the method name `ssh` and turning it into the command name.
- If we wrote the name in camel case Spring would turn camelCase humps into "-".
- So `customSsh` would translate to `custom-ssh`.

We can also add a name of our own using the `key` property of the `ShellMethod` annotation:

```java 
@ShellComponent  
public class SSHCommand 
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(key = "my-ssh", value = "connect to remote server") 
	public void ssh(@ShellOption(value = "-s") String remoteServer) 
	{    
		log.info(format("Logged to machine '%s'", remoteServer)); 
	}  
}
```  

### Working with Command Parameters
Commands can take parameters as input from the user. Spring Shell offers a simple and easy way to introduce parameters.

#### Parameter Naming
As we've seen from the previous example, command parameters are expressed through method parameters.

We can specify the name of the parameter using the `value` property of the `@ShellOption` annotation.

If we don't specify the value however, Spring Shell assigns it a default value of parameter name "-" separated prefixed by `ShellMethod.prefix()`. 

The default value for `@ShellMethod.prefix()` is "--":

```java  
@ShellComponent  
public class SSHCommand 
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(key = "my-ssh", prefix = "-", value = "connect to remote server") 
	public void ssh(@ShellOption String remoteServer) 
	{    
		log.info(format("Logged to machine '%s'", remoteServer)); 
	}  
}
```  
Then, our command would be something like:
```bash
Cool Machine==> my-ssh -remote-server test
2022-02-27 12:39:14.800  INFO 11704 --- [           main] i.r.springshell.command.SSHCommand       : Logged to machine 'test'
``` 

#### Declaring Default Parameters Values
We can assign default values to parameters in case the user doesn't specify any. Doing this also allows the user to treat those parameters as optional:
```java  
@ShellComponent  
public class SSHCommand 
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(value = "connect to remote server") 
	public void ssh(@ShellOption(value = "--s", defaultValue = "default-server") String remoteServer) 
	{    
		log.info(format("Logged to machine '%s'", remoteServer)); 
	}  
}
```  
Typing only `ssh` to the console will give us:
```bash  
shell:>ssh  
2022-02-11 19:55:05.133  INFO 4700 --- [           main] j.t.springshell.command.SSHCommand       : Logged to machine 'default-server'
```  

#### Multi-valued Parameters
We can specify multiple values for a single parameter by using the `arity()` attribute of the `@ShellOption` annotation. Simply use a collection or array for the parameter type, and specify how many values are expected":
```java  
@ShellComponent  
public class SSHCommand 
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(value = "add keys") 
	public void sshAdd(@ShellOption(value = "--k", arity = 2) String[] keys) 
	{    
		log.info(format("Adding keys '%s' '%s'", keys[0], keys[1])); 
	}  
}
```  

Let's try the command out in the shell:

```bash  
shell:>ssh-add --k test1 test2  
2022-02-12 18:27:00.301  INFO 4928 --- [           main] j.t.springshell.command.SSHCommand       : Adding keys 'test1' 'test2'
```  

#### Working with Boolean Parameters
Boolean parameters receive a special treatment by command-line utilities. The absence of the parameter in the command indicates a false value. On the other hand, its existence indicates true value:
```java  
@ShellComponent  
public class SSHCommand 
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(value = "sign in") 
	public void sshLogin(@ShellOption(value = "--r") boolean rememberMe) 
	{    
		log.info(format("remember me option is '%s'", rememberMe)); 
	}  
}
```  
Let's check it out in the command line:
```bash  
shell:>ssh-login --r  
2022-02-12 18:41:34.903  INFO 10044 --- [           main] j.t.springshell.command.SSHCommand       : remember me option is 'true'

shell:>ssh-login  
2022-02-12 18:41:44.606  INFO 10044 --- [           main] j.t.springshell.command.SSHCommand       : remember me option is 'false'
```  
#### Validating Command Parameters

Spring Shell integrates with the  [Bean Validation API](https://beanvalidation.org/)  to provide us with automatic and self-documenting constraints on command parameters.
Validation annotations found on command parameters as well as annotations at the method level will trigger validation prior to the command executing.

Let's try this in action by adding a `@Size` annotation to the method parameter:
```java  
@ShellComponent  
public class SSHCommand 
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(value = "ssh agent") public void sshAgent(    
	        @ShellOption(value = "--a")    
	@Size(min = 2, max = 10) String agent) 
	{    
		log.info(format("adding agent '%s'", agent)); 
	}  
}
```  
Now, if we try to pass a parameter value with a length of 1 we will get an error stating the reason:
```bash  
shell:>ssh-agent --a t  
The following constraints were not met:  --a string : size must be between 2 and 10 (You passed 't')  
```  

Note that the `@Size` annotation is a part of the [Jakarta Bean Validation](https://beanvalidation.org/) which offers many more validation options like `@NotEmpty` `@Max`.


## Dynamic Command Availability
Some commands only make sense when certain pre-conditions are met. For example, a `sign-out` command should be available only if a `sign-in` command has been issued, and if the user tries to run the `sign-out` command we want to warn them that it's not possible.

Spring Shell offers us **three** ways to achieve our goal.

### Create a Method to Check Availability
It checks our class for a method with a special name and with a return type of `Availability`.  
The special name has to be in the format `commandToCheckAvailability`:
```java  
@ShellComponent 
public class SSHLoggingCommand 
{    
    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(SSHLoggingCommand.class.getName());    
    private boolean signedIn;    
    
    @ShellMethod(value = "sign in")    
    public void signIn()    
    {    
        this.signedIn = true;    
        log.info("Signed In!");    
    }    
    
    @ShellMethod(value = "sign out")    
    public void signOut()    
    {    
        this.signedIn = false;    
        log.info("Signed out!");    
    }    
    // note the naming     
   public Availability signOutAvailability()    
    {    
        return signedIn ?    
                Availability.available() : Availability.unavailable("Must be signed in first");    
	} 
}  
``` 
So if we try to run the `sign-out` command without first signing in we will get the following message:
```bash  
shell:>sign-out  
Command 'sign-out' exists but is not currently available because Must be signed in firstDetails of the error have been omitted. You can use the stacktrace command to print the full stacktrace.shell:>  
```  

### Specifying the Name of the Availability Method
Uses the `@ShellMethodAvailability` annotation, in which we specify the method name we want to use to Availability check:
```java  
@ShellComponent  
public  class  SSHLoggingCommand  
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(value = "sign out") 
	@ShellMethodAvailability("signOutCheck") 
	public void signOut() 
	{    
	    this.signedIn = false;    
		log.info("Signed out!"); 
	}  
		
	public Availability signOutCheck() 
	{    
	   return signedIn ?  Availability.available() : Availability.unavailable("Must be signed in first"); 
	}  
}
``` 

### One Availability Method for Multiple Commands
It enables us to have several methods attached to a single availability method.  
We are going to use the annotation `ShellMethodAvailability` with an array of the commands names (not method names):

```java  
@ShellComponent  
public  class  SSHLoggingCommand  
{
	...
	@ShellMethod(value = "sign out") public void signOut() 
	{    
	    this.signedIn = false;    
		log.info("Signed out!"); 
	}    

	 @ShellMethod(value = "Change password") 
	 public void changePass(@ShellOption String newPass) 
	 {    
		log.info(format("Changed password to '%s'", newPass)); 
	 }    
	 
	 @ShellMethodAvailability({"sign-out", "change-pass"}) 
	 public Availability signOutCheck() 
	 {    
	    return signedIn ? Availability.available() : Availability.unavailable("Must be signed in first"); 
	}  
}
```  

## Other Cool Features in Spring Shell
Since Spring Shell builds on top of [JLine](https://github.com/jline/jline3) it inherits a lot of its features. Let's look at some of them:

### Tab Completion
Spring Shell allows us to use tab completion with command names and even with parameter names. Since this feature is a part of JLine we can use it out of the box with no need for any configuration.

### Built-in Commands
Spring Shell offers us a set of useful built-in commands. Let's take a look at two important ones:

- `help`:  lists all the commands known to the shell, including the built-in commands and commands we wrote.

- `script`:  accepts a local file as an argument and will replay commands found there, one at a time.


## Styling the Shell
We can do so by registering a bean of type `PromptProvider` which includes information on how to render the Shell prompt.  
For example, let's change the prompt text to `Cool Machine==> ` with a green color for the text:
```java  
@Component 
public class CustomPromptProvider implements PromptProvider 
{    
    @Override    
  public AttributedString getPrompt() 
  {    
            return new AttributedString(    
                    "Cool Machine" + "==> ",    
                    AttributedStyle.DEFAULT.background(AttributedStyle.GREEN));    
	} 
}  
``` 
This will give us a prompt like this
```bash
2022-02-26 23:37:49.949  INFO 6560 --- [           main] i.r.springshell.SpringShellApplication   : Started SpringShellApplication in 2.267 seconds (JVM running for 3.77)
Cool Machine==> 
```

## Running the Shell from the Jar File

After obtaining the JAR file we run it using the command `java -jar our-spring-shell-jar-name.jar`. This will open our shell in the command line and have it ready for us to type in commands.


## Summary
- The Shell allows us to interface with a system using commands.

- Spring Shell introduces a simple and quick way to build a Shell leveraging all the good sides of the Spring framework.

- The three main building blocks of Spring Shell are 
  - `@ShellComponent` 
  - `@ShellMethod` 
  - `@ShellOption`.
- Spring Shell is built on top of **JLine** which offers useful features like tab completion and built in commands.
- We can choose to make some commands available based on certain conditions.
- We can style the command line as we like.
